Review,Sentiment
"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive
"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",Positive
"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",Positive
"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",Positive
"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.",Positive
"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive
"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",Positive
"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive
"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",Positive
"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Negative
"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive
"There are a few other reviews here echoing the same sentiments. I asked the people sitting next to me what they thought and they were disappointed. I can't help feel the same. I have a strong background in nuclear physics. It was intriguing, but it was cut so jarringly that it was hard to keep up what was going on.Then finally, we have the big event that everyone was selling this movie on, and it was quite underwhelming. The characters don't do enough to catch my feelings. The only standouts for me were Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt, but RDJ's whole character arc was that he was insecure and just wanted petty revenge??The whole last hour I was checking the time hoping it would end, because I was just bored.",Negative
"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'killers of the flower moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity.",Positive
"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral
"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",Positive
"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",Positive
"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay! The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!",Neutral
"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",Positive
"The movie was ok. There were some cool scenes, great acting, fantastic cinematography, and excellent sound design.The problem I really had with the movie was the sex scenes. They felt out of place. It was shocking to say the least seeing that in the theater. I looked away to be honest because I didn't really want to see that. I don't think it was crucial to the story, there are certainly ways to imply what happened without explicitly showing things.I love Christopher Nolan's movies. I think he is a fantastic filmmaker. For me, this film just didn't hit the mark. I felt more taken out than anything because of some of the content. I still have mixed feelings and I'm not sure what to think.",Positive
Speechless this movie had a very good sound design good visual that will blow your Mind and you will getting the best score in this movie and one thing you all saying this is boring? God help this movie had very good plot and story by freackin Christopher Nolan without even one Freackin CGI and yall still saying this is boring pillow and a blanket yall don't know the plot is and not focus to the story this is top 3 best Christopher Nolan MOVIE i have ever SEEEN and i think for 3 hours movie is too short for this movie i want 4 hoursss and anyway what a good plot twist in the end the acting is badaass good and the rdj deserves an Oscar for this film.,Positive
"A very neat biopic for a life story as complex as Robert Oppenheimer's. With his original back and forth filmmaking style, though I still like Interstellar better, I think this is Christopher Nolan's best work to date.The casting is great. Even for a short screen time, important characters showed up played by huge star such as Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman. The scoring is good enough even though I still think Hans Zimmer is one of major keys Nolan's movies are as good as they are (Batman, Inception, Interstellar, etc.). The ending is very powerful just like what Nolan did with The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar. It is the highlight of the movie for me.",Positive
"Maybe my expectations were off slightly. This was a character study into Oppenheimer and the tribulations of his career, and about his politics rather than truly about the science and production of the A bomb. I was hoping to see more nitty gritty into the bomb's development, and maybe some footage of its use in Japan to really reinforce the human toll and destruction of the immensely powerful weapon that they had created for the final act. Instead its just dramatic closeups of Opp's troubled face. But I feel we needed some more visuals (of war) to establish more emotion. It felt exceedingly anticlimactic.And really, 75% of this movie is a small backroom kangaroo court prosecution that is just flatly boring and soo unnecessarily long.As another reviewer said, you could just listen to the audio of this movie and it would be virtually the same experience. There is nothing visually interesting or exciting.",Negative
"Christopher Nolan, once again, uses astonishing film techniques to embark the audience on an other worldly adventure. He brings to light the historical significance of the Manhattan project and Los Alamos through the scientific and political background of such a unique town portrayed with perfection by such actors as Cillian Murphy and Matt Damon. By using Los Alamos and New Mexico as a film location for the film, Nolan is able to portray what life would have been for Oppenheimer and other scientists with their families around the time of the Trinity test.As someone who grew up in Los Alamos, I could arguably say that Oppenheimer correctly highlights the history of the town and the creation of the atomic bomb alongside Nolan's own creative input to emphasise Oppenheimer's story.Cillian Murphy delivers such a vast and emotionally compelling role by highlighting the moral dilemma Oppenheimer himself faced and on that we deal with in todays age.For being a 3 hr plus film the pacing is incredible and an average movie goer can endure such horror, mystery, and drama all in one storyline that fills holes at the end created in the beginning.",Neutral
"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",Positive
"Yeah, I got lost a few times in this movie by the continual switching time periods. And had a difficult time understanding some of the dialogue because of the loud soundtrack. I felt it was an hour too long! Excellent acting kept me interested. Robert Downy Jr. Was amazing! The sex scenes were completely unnecessary, added nothing to the story. And in those days, it wasn't graphically presented like this. I guess the writers needed to smut it up to keep up with the times! I would never watch this movie again. The movies that I go to theaters to see, I usually end up watching again and again later on. But this movie I won't do that.",Positive
"The story is presented really well and through the eyes of Oppenheimer. 90% of the movie feels like a flashback scene which though looks really cool, doesn't actually feel like something I would watch again. As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s. There were so many characters and sub-stories that it felt like someone compressed an entire tv series into a 3 hour long movie.Movie critics will give this a good score owing to its incredible style and presentation and most of the audience will do the same. But purely from an entertainment point of view this was 7/10.",Positive
"Nolan's best film will be in the biographical style. I hope he can do something like Nolan's Inception that will be remembered decades from now, because he himself said that great physicists were used for this film to work with precision and seriousness.Particle for direct object
CGI special effects are not used in this movie. It can be said that this excites people. Anyway, this year's movie is going to be better, no doubt about it and I'm really looking forward to it.It would be great if it became the best film of this year and the best director nominee.Nolan's amazing love You so much .",Positive
"I was immediately taken by Cillian Murphy's entrance as Oppenheimer and then the seriousness of the proceedings. Christopher Nolan has already proven he is a director for the ages. Actors bend over backwards to work with him even in small, one scene parts. Here Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck and Remi Malek for instance. But is Cillian Murphy who envelopes the entire journey with the kind of truth that makes the whole thing utterly compelling. I've loved Cillian Murphy since his miraculous ""Breakfast On Pluto"" Here he is is extraordinary. Extraordinary! Visually, the film is a marvel without ever falling into an effects-fest. Superb.",Positive
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in. It reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK, which I love.",Positive
"This movie is a cinematic masterpiece!The acting, storytelling, the score and visuals were just amazing in it.This movie proves that Cillian Murphy is a lead actor. The deliverance and his eye movement was a treat of it's own. I couldn't have picked a better actor to play Oppenheimer.RDJ showed us that he can still roll with the big boys of the industry and everyone was just amazing in it.This movie isn't just a story how the atomic bomb was made, but also how Oppenheimer and the entire staff of his scratched and clawed to ""victory"". As a viewer, you immediately join them on this adventure and you feel every bit of tension in this film.The trinity test was the highlight of the movie. It took my breath away and made me feel part of the crew as they saw the bomb explode in front of their eyes.If you had any doubt watching it, don't hesitate!WATCH IT IN IMAX AND I GUARANTEE YOU WILL LEAVE THE THEATER WITH THE BEST IMAX EXPERIENCE YOU'VE EVER HAD!",Positive
"Imagine a fire that you brought from the heaven and you give that fire to human , and that fire is used by humans to burn this world.Oppenheimer is not an easy historical character to play, he is a historical character full of regret and guilt. However, Murphy plays this character perfectly, his eyes filled with those emotios, the way he responds to every other supporting character's utterances is simply outstanding. Even if his only response was eye movement, or a blank stare in an uncertain direction, Everything can be understood. Also, His body gestures also complement his extraordinary acting.""They won't fear it, until they understand it, the won't understand it, until they use it."" A sentence that explains the dangers of a nuclear bomb. And the way he conveyed it really looked real and as if he already understood what was going to happen.He also played Oppenheimer's flaws perfectly, He's a pretty selfish and sometimes rebellious guy. Committing adultery with a woman who is not his wife, and has feelings that are very binding with his that girl, When the woman's death, we can see that Oppenheimer was devastated.Then for the scoring, It's really amazing. First it sound so grand, The atomic bomb is a very grandiose thing, But over time the music got louder and louder, shows a very deep fear.The sound effects also produce a feeling for the audience to feel the horror of atomic bomb. The stomping of those feet against the wooden floor couldn't escape my head until now.Lastly is the cinematography, every angle is taken perfectly, the practical effects are really pleasing to the eye. The approach to Murphy's face in the final scene literally describes Oppenheimer's entire life. The explosion was also really grandiose.Christopher Nolan literally describes it all perfectly, and I have absolutely no words to compliment this man. If you want to feel Christopher Nolan's way of seeing the world, watch this film. 3 hours passed without getting bored, like only an hour.That is all from me. Thank you.",Positive
"This movie is an experience. The direction, cinematography and music will take you away. The performances from all the main actors are Oscar worthy. This movie will defy your expectations. Cillian Murphy is definitely Oscar's number 1 contender.Now I understand that this may not be every person's cup of tea. Some people are seriously going to this movie expecting to have a "" fun"" time. Tho movie speaks about ""probably"" the world's biggest catastrophe EVER. Some conversations are very heavy to bear but this is the world we live in and the choices humans and governments make every day.Can't wait to see Barbie next.",Neutral
"If this was not a Christopher Nolan movie, it would not even be noticed. It's hard to understand also why this movie would need to be seen in an IMAX theatre. It is probably mainly down to the subject matter, but I felt it was boring, predictable, and the void of any of the intricate storytelling and uniqueness that I have come to like about Nolan movies. One gets the impression that this movie is getting the attention it does because of the history of its maker, but not on the merit of its own performance. The hype is definitely over done on this one. There was some decent acting, especially from Downey Jr. And Damon.",Negative
"The cinematic genius Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly one of the finest stars in the film industry.

Hats off to the prodigious Christopher Nolan, who will remain a symbol of creativity and distinction in the world of cinema for thousands of years to come!.And all of this will apply to Oppenheimer film, which will reflect all of Christopher's art in this work.",Positive
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",Positive
"God what an absolute mess. To all the people saying ""you need to pay attention and have your brain fully switched on""... that doesn't make this ""intelligent film"". It makes it an overcomplicated nightmare. Nolan's movies have gone so far downhill since Dunkirk. The mess of 3 timelines is not needed for the entirety of every film. It works well for the majority of inception, the climax of the dark knight, parts of interstellar- but this? Not at all.Nolan desperately needs a writing partner that tells him ""NO"". This film would've been so much stronger with 40 less minutes of chatter before the bomb test, and 30 minutes less after the test. I absolutely LOVE long, ""boring"" movies. I'm a freak for Malick or Reichardt, but this? I would've left if I wasn't with friends.Nolan has a difficult time when directing anything slightly out of his comfort zone. The scene of Florence Pugh in the chair during the interview, the overdramtic yells of Emily Blunt, both had me biting my fist in cringe.No amount of quick cuts or dramatic music were able to convince me I was being entertained.",Positive
"Nolan made the telling of the story as complicated as he possibly could... as is his way. Made it a story of McCarthy inquisition and told the story of the Manhattan project via a sequence of flashbacks to overdramatised moments with actors expressing pithy cliches. Turned the story of the biggest applied R&D project in history and development of applied atomic science into an individual cult of personality and a bureaucratic conspiracy. Not the story I tuned in for, and i struggle to believe this found any sort of broad audience. Nice suits, great lighting, overbearing music, a very long and tediously, implausibly dramatised telling of a significant history.",Positive
"First off, the dialogues are actually audible, quite clear, happy that they mended this in comparison to Nolan's last outing Tenet.Secondly, a captivating story told in a even more captivating way.The acting is perhaps best of the year so far, Oscar nominations galore.I saw it on a digital IMAX screen, very pristine and filmy.Sound, cinematography and score are stand outs too.Only thing is, this film would have been a even better mini series.The run time and intense dialogues/ intrigues can be quite draining to the viewer.As a Dutchman I noticed that, Oppenheimer did not speak Dutch in the film, it sounded like an Irishman trying to speak German. Half a point deduction.Not Nolan's best but it is up there, like the bellowing smoke from a nuclear explosion.8.5/10Let's go to James Bond 007 next, Nolan!",Positive
"""Oppenheimer"" by Christopher Nolan is a film that delves deep into the consequences of the atomic bomb, focusing on Oppenheimer's perspective. This film requires a genuine passion for physics or history to fully appreciate its subtleties and biographical content.The imagery of the various explosions, accompanied by carefully orchestrated music and sound effects, creates an intense visual and auditory experience. At times, they even evoke feelings of tension and stress, enhancing the viewer's immersion in the story.The performances by the actors are remarkable, especially Cillian Murphy's brilliant portrayal of Oppenheimer. His captivating and nuanced interpretation brings this complex character to life, while Matt Damon, in the role of General Groves, delivers a solid and convincing presence.The film skillfully explores different temporal tones, offering a non-linear narrative that adds an additional depth to the story. The smooth transitions between color and black-and-white sequences add an artistic and symbolic dimension to the overall experience. These aesthetic choices enhance the emotional impact of the narrative and clearly distinguish the different eras and events.It's worth noting that to fully appreciate this film, prior interest in the history of the atomic bomb, as well as Oppenheimer's life and work, is necessary. With a duration of three hours, the film may seem lengthy to those who are not invested in these specific subjects.The story is divided into three distinct parts, with the first two closely interconnected. The first part focuses on Oppenheimer's training as a physicist, highlighting his interactions with Heisenberg and other eminent scientists of the time. The second part centers around the creation of the atomic bomb, the tests conducted at Los Alamos, and the scientific challenges faced by the team. The final part of the film focuses on Oppenheimer's hearing, where certain high-ranking officials, envious of his accomplishments, attempt to discredit him by presenting him as a spy working for the Soviets.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a film that delves deep into the history of the atomic bomb, offering remarkable performances, impressive visuals, and complex storytelling. It is an immersive cinematic experience that reveals the moral, scientific, and historical aspects of this pivotal event in our history.Special mention goes to the fantastic Gary Oldman, who is completely unrecognizable in the role of President Truman.",Positive
"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
"Now biography movies is something I will almost never sit down and watch. I did it with The Killers Of The Flower Moon (which is a movie I highly recommend you watch if you liked Oppenheimer) and I loved it even though the movie is too long and it may exhaust some viewers. Oppenheimer touches a topic I am such a fan of but what I said about all movies that talk about real eras, I did not sit down to watch a historical lecture, I sat down to watch a movie...And as a movie, judging every element a movie should have to be great, It is spectacular. The cast and therefore the acting is amazing, the cinematography is perfect (You should expect nothing less from Christopher Nolan) and the movie is formed and coated in a way that even though it is long it tries to keep the viewer's attention on the movie as much as possible, adding suspense and some jawdropping scenes (like the scene where the first bomb is dropped). They say that if you don't like a movie or a video game genre you should not watch/play it let alone judge it harshly if you don't like it and I couldn't agree more to that. However , even though I really liked Oppenheimer I can't but rate it an 8 because as I said I am not a fan of this type of movies. That doesn't mean anything at all though. If you like biography and drama movies this will most likely be a perfect movie for you. Recommended.",Positive
"I'm amazed how great storytelling this was. This inhuman thing to do, making a bomb that maker doesn't even know the limits of destruction, director showed this in a human way. This was a simple story. But curiosities were maintained well with flashbacks and sudden reminders. I think the director's intention to show us how Oppenheimer saw this discovery was successful. Oppenheimer was proud of it and first then he regrets as soon as he found out how bombs were used. Cillan did very beautiful job playing this smart yet troubled personal life man. Robert Downey and Florence Pugh were best as supporting actors. Their involvement with main character added so much emotion to this film. Music in this movie is another appreciated thing. I know people who don't like classical music might call it boring but to me this was a true gem. Soundtrack kept us hoooked in to the flow of story.",Positive
"The mood of this film is wistfulness and regret. There are moments of the signature Nolan adventure of a vaguely outlined protagonist fighting against time and challenging odds. A film about creating the first atomic bomb could have leaned into that aspect.However, that is not the film Nolan made. Predominately through the protagonist, Oppenheimer, whose failings as a husband, father and tactician are made clear, we experience his particular regrets and troubles through close-ups and subjective viewpoints. This is neither a pure hero narrative (his leadership at Los Alamos), nor a pure innocent victim narrative (his loss of position as his left-wing politics is used against him in the 1950s).I watch this as a student of physics and what stands out is how much Nolan includes physicists of that time, often only in passing or as side characters that make no direct contribution to the narrative. The film begins and ends with Einstein and his troubled mood. I think these two aspects engender a subtler form of wistfulness and regret: what might science have been like if the Second World War and Nazism had not pitted these great minds against each other and made physics a tool of war rather than a means to look into the strange microscopic world? That is great filmmaking.I cannot quite give the film full points because it spends too much time on the political maneuvers of Admiral Strauss. He is not a good antagonist and it sidetracks the narrative with themes of a one-sided political thriller.",Positive
"The story is about J. Robert Oppenheimer, lovingly called Oppie, who is (maybe) wrongfully suspected of being a security risk, a suspicion cunningly used by another man who doesn't like Oppie, and therefore Oppie loses his security clearance, but later the second man experiences consequences of his unjust behaviour. Oppie doesn't regain his security clearance but gets decorated, which makes his wife happy. In a sideline to the story several hundreds of thousands of civilians get killed by the bomb Oppie developed, which costs him (Oppie) at least a few nights of good sleep, earning him the title of crybaby by Harry S. Truman.",Positive
"It took me three nights to get through this film. Yes I know it won awards, but I found myself getting distracted. Maybe it's because the material is so difficult and the man himself is not that likable that I found myself disengaging. So you can see this is not really critique of the film itself but my reaction to it which is a course with all critiques are. This one is perhaps not as pundit worthy, but I'm gonna power through it so I can just remember that I watched this and take it off my watchlist although probably I should watch it again. So, there you have it, folks. Well done, but not captivating.",Neutral
"I went with my adult kids and we all had the same reaction. The movie was not what we were expecting. The morning of the viewing i was watching the news and they were saying ""the best movie of the year"" and a ""perfect movie"" and ""you must see it in IMAX"".. None of that was close to being true. While an informative movie on Oppenheimer's personal life , not a lot on the inside story of the making of the bomb or the science behind it . Mostly drama about whether or not he had communist affiliations. IMAX was completely useless, there was no great action scenes or great sounds or music. I""m sorry but i don't understand all the 10's, whatever happened to a 10 meaning perfection.",Positive
"I registered out of disappointment after seeing this film and disbelief at so many enthusiastic reviews.It is not a terrible film, mind me, but definitely below Nolan's (inter)stellar standards.From the emphatic acting, to the bombastic soundtrack, to the (ab)use of trivial special effects: to me everything seemed over the top, blatant, exaggerated and overloaded, pretentious and decidedly lacking the finesse Nolan has accustomed us to. In that, it reminded me of Spielberg's indigestible The Fabelmans.Another huge problem is that the characters came across as stereotypical, particularly the members of the committee. The way Oppenheimer's supposed moral dilemma is portrayed is very naive, and the protagonist's facial expressions can only do so much to convey the inner struggle.Like most of Nolan's films, this one is also very long, which becomes a problem when the story development lacks the compelling inspiration of Interstellar, Inception, and especially The Dark Knight. The film drags on for 3 hours in a very predictable and boring way, so much that some viewers showed signs of relief when the film finally ended. I was among them.Overall unremarkable, if not a major disappointment.",Negative
"Befitting the Manhattan project timeline this film has many moving parts all at nearly the speed of sound. But don't despair, the stories are solid and held together through Oppenheimer's persistence and peculiarities.The genesis of the project began years earlier in Germany and the Quantum Physics heavyweights go toe to toe with egos and smarts.I am going to watch this again and again because it is detailed to the nth degree but those details are pixels framing the bigger picture: the struggles of one man contemporaneously brilliant and reckless: astute and naive, loving and aloof. Oppenheimers job was much more difficult than the 2nd most difficult job on the planet: that job was held by Eisenhower who smoked five packs of cigarettes and drank 20 cups of coffee per day to get through it. It nearly killed Ike and Oppenheimer.Wonderfully cast and superbly filmed, this longer film is a reward for those who enjoy all aspects of filmmaking.Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Give the best dramatic performances I've seen in decades. Mind blowing performances.",Positive
"Christopher Nolan hasn't always been my favorite director, and i'd say watching Oppenheimer changed that view completely... it was such a joy to watch, it's whimsical, thought provoking and most of all beautiful. It's such a pretty film and just gorgeous to look at, the ending is such a hard thing to get around because it's a known fact that Oppenheimer must've regretted his creation, but nobody really thought about the TRUE effect it had on modern life and the way war works as we know it. And it just throws a complete life changing statement at you, and you don't know what to do. I was speechless. Cillian Murphy is absolutely brilliant in this film.I love this film so much, it's my favorite film from 2023 and most likely in my top 10 of all time, masterpiece.",Positive
"After waiting for a year and seven months, I finally watched Oppenheimer, and it was totally worth every second of anticipation! The cinematography in Oppenheimer is a visual masterpiece. Each frame is meticulously crafted, immersing the audience into the world of the story. The way the scenes are shot and the use of lighting and color contribute to the film's captivating atmosphere.The chronological timeline of the movie is a true work of art. Nolan's seamless transitions between different periods in history not only keep the narrative engaging but also provide a deeper understanding of the characters and the historical events surrounding them. It's a brilliant storytelling technique that keeps you hooked from start to finish.",Neutral
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",Positive
This is one of Christopher Nolan's best thrilling rides he has directed. The cast in this film is fantastic and the acting performances from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Is amazing in this film. Ludwig Goransson made one of his best scores for this film. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen. The set designs and builds are amazing as well. The way the story is put together with seeing Oppenheimer's story from the begging the middle and the end all at once. The idea and tension that is built up when they talk about how the atmosphere could possibly light up and catch fire was a great move and helped the stakes of the film. The shots and noises that we got for when the Atomic Bomb was dropped was awesome. You really start to see how Oppenheimer was used by the U. S. to make the bomb and was shoved to the side afterwards. You also see the toll of being the creator of sutch a weapon that destroyed so many lives. You also see how corrupt some of these government politicians are and how no one tells the truth up there in the big world. The aspects and part of the film cover Louis Straws was really good. It added a lot more depth to the film and story. The twists that he ended up getting rejected in his appeal for the cabinet spot by John F. Kennedy was really cool done super well. The realization that Oppenheimer did destroy the world in his eyes by making the Atomic Bomb in a different way than they thought was amazing as well. 10/10 STARS.,Positive
"""Oppenheimer"" (Film, directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Cillian Murphy):Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into one of the most crucial periods in history-the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. With an unparalleled vision and storytelling prowess, Nolan takes the audience on an immersive journey, bringing to life the complexities and moral dilemmas faced by J. Robert Oppenheimer, brilliantly portrayed by the talented Cillian Murphy.The film's attention to historical accuracy and its meticulous recreation of the era is awe-inspiring. Nolan's direction is as gripping as ever, creating a sense of tension and urgency that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. The use of practical effects and stunning visuals adds an unparalleled level of realism that transports the audience back in time.Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer is nothing short of remarkable. He effortlessly captures the inner turmoil of the scientist, torn between his loyalty to his country and the ethical implications of developing such a devastating weapon. Murphy's ability to convey complex emotions through nuanced expressions and dialogue makes him the perfect choice for the role.Nolan's signature nonlinear storytelling adds another layer of intrigue to the narrative, unfolding Oppenheimer's life in a non-chronological manner, revealing key events that shaped his character. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, complements the storytelling beautifully, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene.""Oppenheimer"" is a thought-provoking film that goes beyond the historical context and addresses broader philosophical themes about the human condition and the responsibilities of scientists in the face of unprecedented power. It challenges the audience to reflect on the consequences of scientific advancements and the choices individuals make in critical moments of history.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that combines Christopher Nolan's directorial brilliance, Cillian Murphy's captivating performance, and a compelling historical narrative. This film will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on viewers, solidifying its place as one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema.",Positive
"Too many characters, facts and layers of stories that you develop anxieties watching as to be hopeful not to missed any details so that might make the whole movie incomprehensible. Great cast, not so interesting cinematic experience totally not worth IMAX tickets.I think Nolan should focus on sci fi movies and things that he can do as he pleased and not bounded by facts. Its a real pleasure to watch interstellar and inceptions that I have certain expectations on his movies but Oppenheimer and Dunkirk proved that he might not be up to a legendary director level for biographical movies and fact / history.",Positive
"Best Cinematic Movie of 2023 and OSCAR NOMINATED 2024. Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless.Star-studded cast was not just for nothing, they truly, truly delivers each character perfectly. Especially Cillian, damn, brilliant performance. I truly wish that I could watch it in IMAX 70mm, the way they originally filmed it with.It is three hours long but I highly recommend you guys to watch Oppenheimer in the best theatre you could find in your city. Yes its gonna be boring if you're just accompanying your friend or S/O without actually intended to invest your time in this.",Positive
"The Christopher Nolan obsession with time jumping hits maximum overdrive in Oppenheimer. It's a blizzard of back and forth, color to black and white (even though black and white is in the future from color which adds even more confusion), with only the added gray of a person's hair to give us any indication of when we are at, and no years ever given for reference at any point in the movie.This could have been an intriguing story of Oppenheimer and how factors of his youth influenced his thinking and led him to the success he had in leading the development of the atomic bomb and how that ended the war against Japan. Instead there is little backdrop or insight into what was driving him, short shrift on the development and war, and the focus is mainly on the painful McCarthyism investigation and the petty double dealings of this movie's primary antagonist, Strauss.I watched this movie at home and it took me several days to get through it because of how painfully pedantic it was. The dialogue drones on and on trying to make something dramatic out of a security clearance hearing. I just couldn't get into it. I still gave it a 6 because there are some magnificent acting performances by Murphy, Downey and Blunt but they're the only thing holding this mess together.",Neutral
"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!! Period!!",Neutral
"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",Negative
"10/10. Gripping, suspenseful and surprisingly intimate. Great casting, even better performances, superb dialogue, and fantastic story telling. Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey, and even Gary Oldman (as short as his time was in the film) deserve Oscar nominations at the very least. Emily blunt was also amazing. This is Nolan's best work and it's not even close. Every scene had meaning, no useless scenes or useless dialogue. A lot of people seem to forget it's not just about the Manhattan project, it's about OPPENHEIMER.Most of the bad reviews are from people who think the dark knight trilogy is Nolan's best work.",Positive
"Pretty long film no doubt, But I had expectations because we were told by the cast and the director Christopher Nolan during the interviews, that the audience would be able to experience what destructive power an atomic bomb has just like what we can see for an explosion in Nuclear reactor visually in the show by HBO, Chernobyl.Disappointed, that nothing was shown visually, I couldn't connect with the guilt Oppenheimer had when he said, ""he feels blood on his hand"". Nevertheless, it is just a fulfilling documentary about J. Robert Oppenheimer depicted in the film, don't expect anything more.",Negative

"For every minute that passes during the 3-hour run time of the movie Oppenheimer, 1200 citizens in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki died. If you haven't got to see the movie it's worth pointing out that Oppenheimer - is not an anti nuclear movie. Nor is it a dramatic reconstruction of the devastating consequences of the use of the first nuclear bombs against the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For this, you would be better advised to seek out the superior acclaimed BBC drama documentary Hiroshima (2005.)
That film graphically dramatised what it is like to live through a Nuclear attack, millisecond by horror filled millisecond.The Oppenheimer movie pretty much sidled past that part of the horror story.Oppenheimer is a well made biopic of a man, or to be more accurate - a ghoul. A man who wilfully, along with his Los Alamos buddies, messed round with plutonium, mined from thousands of uranium mines to build a weapon that would annihilate the civilian populations of two cities and possibly one day humanity.What's good: A fast paced immersive movie into the allegedly tortured mind of the director of the Manhattan Project J. Robert Oppenheimer. His team delivered a fission bomb to the US airforce at the cost of $2 billion dollars. The lead up to and the culmination of the Trinity Test contains the movie's strongest moments.What's bad: The story of the creation of the worst imaginable weapon and the consequences of its use is virtually skimmed over in favour of the McCarthy era security hearing of Oppenheimer in 1954, which resulted in his losing his 'security clearance.'
The hearing, the movie shows, was secretly instigated by Levi Strauss, the director of the post war Atomic Energy Commission. Strauss who had taken over the Manhattan project in 1946, never got on with Oppenheimer, who apposed the development of the hydrogen bomb.While it's an interesting story, it decidedly distracts from the real horror of what happened to the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and descends - somewhat - into yet another attempt to justify the actions and subsequent hegemony of the United States. They even manage to name check JFK near the end for a little old fashioned jingoism.It's a good movie. But it would be timely for Netflix to stream When the Wind Blows (1986) and The Day After (1983) as well as the aforementioned BBC Hiroshima (2005)",Positive
"As a general overview the movie has great pacing. While somewhat on the longer side the rising and falling tension along with the back and forth from case to events allows the viewer to feel constantly involved. Acting is well done on many parts and the sound effects and score genuinely enhance the feel of each scene brining the viewer to the edge of their seat and back. As a small negative side, I personally would have liked to see more visuals incorporated with explanations and development of the phsyics / science used through out the film. But all in all it is a wonderful movie worth the watch.",Positive
"The film failed to deliver on the hype. It is certainly Oscar-material, well produced and with great actors, but that doesn' t mean it was entertaining. The three hours were a bit too long, and, by the way,, what's so wrong with the traditional 2h-format, not many films deserve longer than that, and Oppenheimer is not one of them.. In my opinion too much footage was wasted on the congressional hearing and on the 'trial', which may be intresting for an American audience, but not so much for international viewers. The ethical dilemnas on building the bomb were justed hinted at, and that would have a more universal appeal.",Positive
"Anything that Nolan is involved in, I will go and see, the track record is enough to get me through the doors and on that seat.Oppenheimer represented something of a challenge to me the first time round, after a busy day at work, I went to see it, and at three hours long, after Barbie, it was too much, last night I watched it properly for the second time.As a casual viewer, it's a tough one, but if you're engaged and prepared, this is one outstanding movie. I am on no doubt whatsoever that this film will do very well in terms of awards, the whole cinema was totally immersed, the room was silent.The pacing builds as the film progresses, the second half was the best part, and I loved the ending.It gives some fascinating insight into the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.",Positive
"I feel a bit disappointed with this movie. It was underwhelming for me. I know it's a biopic, but when the maker says you should watch it on a big screen, I expect it to contain a bit more science, something worthy of a big screen. But what we get is a biopic with a lot of politics and courtroom drama. I guess walking into a Nolan movie always expecting a spectacle like Inception or Interstellar can be disappointing.The performances from the stellar cast are as expected phenomenal. The movie is good, well made but it does get boring at times. I expected more from the biopic of the father of the atom bomb.",Positive
"Yes, the acting for the most part is excellent. However, the movie/story does a grave injustice to the portrayal of a brilliant and complex human being. It presents a poorly edited one dimensional view of his life, a disjointed story dwelling mostly on political issues and travails. There was very little portrayal of his leadership skills in assembling brilliant minds to solve extremely complex, complicated issues. Overall, a missed opportunity to present the true richness of this incredible mind to the world. The editing seemed calculated to provide some of the actors with more screen time, and an opportunity to demonstrate their acting. By the end, I found myself wondering when it would end.",Positive
"I sometimes struggle with movies that jump around in the space/time continuum. And that happened here. It takes effort to figure out what is going on. It becomes exhausting dealing with the timeline jumps.I do like Nolan's films and was ready to like this a lot.I'm sure most of you have seen this movie already...
The actor who plays Oppenheimer is very strange looking and that also took some of my attention. I am the last to judge but he's just very weird with eyes and a face that always looks surprised.Anyway, I wasn't enjoying it all that much until it got near the ending when Rami Malek shows up and the point of it suddenly clicked into place.It's not so much a science history movie as a political drama. Duh.Because it is theoretically about history and a very interesting time and event, I should have just loved this movie, and I don't know what it was that made it such a chore to watch other than it told much of its story via what happens in two hearings (one public, one private). Perhaps I am getting old and grumpy.As it got to the end and the ""clicking into place"" happened, I thought I should watch it again.. but at 3 hours? I doubt that I will. It is a long movie, to be sure, but weirdly the development of the bomb seems pretty fast. There's a disconnect there.It is worth mentioning Robert Downy Jr at this point. He's wonderful as the ""heavy"". I miss him in the MCU movies. In fact, I miss those glory days of MCU movies...

"Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this gripping biographical drama. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was nothing short of extraordinary; he brought an incredible depth and complexity to the character, making the genius physicist feel hauntingly real.Nolan's direction was masterful as always, seamlessly blending history, science, and emotion. The visuals were breathtaking, transporting us back to the era of the Manhattan Project with stunning attention to detail. The use of practical effects and practical sets added a sense of authenticity that further immersed me in the story.One aspect that stood out was the film's exploration of Oppenheimer's moral dilemmas and the weight of the decisions he faced. The screenplay didn't shy away from the ethical implications of his work on the atomic bomb, forcing the audience to confront the morally gray areas of scientific progress during wartime.What impressed me the most was Nolan's ability to present complex scientific concepts in an accessible way without oversimplifying them. The film catered to both science enthusiasts and general audiences, striking a perfect balance between intellectual stimulation and emotional resonance.While Oppenheimer may not be an action-packed thriller like some of Nolan's previous works, its slow and deliberate pacing allowed for a profound and thought-provoking experience. By the final act, I found myself questioning the moral implications of scientific advancements and reflecting on the consequences of our choices as a species.",Neutral
"Christopher Nolan has once again delivered a cinematic marvel with his latest film, Oppenheimer. From start to finish, every second of this lengthy masterpiece is worth the journey, offering an unforgettable exploration of human psychology, ethics, gripping scientific discoveries, and perfectly paced storytelling.In a world where biopics can sometimes fall short in capturing the essence of their subjects, Nolan stands apart, pouring his heart and soul into Oppenheimer. Watching the film leaves audiences in awe, reflecting on the incredible artistry they have just experienced. The dialogue writing and conversations are the heart of the film, deftly delving into the complexities of the characters and their moral dilemmas.The elaborative and talented cast is worth mentioning, with Cillian Murphy delivering a stellar performance, portraying Oppenheimer's great complexity with finesse. But it doesn't stop there; every member of the cast leaves a lasting impact on the film, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.Visually, Oppenheimer is a treat for the eyes. From start to finish, the movie offers stunning visuals that capture the essence of the era and transport the audience into the world of Oppenheimer and his groundbreaking scientific endeavors. Especially during the pivotal build-up moments, the visuals are nothing short of breathtaking, leaving viewers at the edge of their seats.One cannot overlook the significant role of sound, music, and symphony in this film. The carefully curated soundscape heightens the emotions and lets the viewers truly feel and immerse themselves in the story. The combination of stunning visuals and a captivating musical score creates a captivating experience that stays with the audience long after the credits roll.Oppenheimer is beautifully shot and well-crafted, showcasing Nolan's dedication to his craft and his willingness to push the boundaries of filmmaking. Instead of settling for a straightforward biopic, Nolan dives deep into the psyche of his characters, delivering one of the most authentic portrayals of this era on the silver screen.It is an absolute triumph. Christopher Nolan's dedication to storytelling, his commitment to exploring the human condition, and his willingness to push cinematic boundaries shine through every frame of this film. It's an emotional and intellectually stimulating journey that deserves to be appreciated and cherished. Take the time to watch this cinematic gem, and you'll be left with a profound sense of awe and admiration for the art of filmmaking. All credit goes to Nolan for creating a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come.",Positive
"Oppenheimer, the movie that dominated the 2024 Oscars. Is it worth your time?Well, maybe a little bit overrated but it's beautifully filmed and directed. The actors did an incredible job, especially RDJ and Murphy. I love the fact that Lewis Strauss' point of view was filmed black and white. However, the cheery on top for me was the ending; I could say that it was worth waiting for it.On the other hand, it was way too long and the first half of the movie was slow, boring and didn't add that much to the whole story; I almost thought of giving up the movie. I feel like it could've been better as a two, maybe two and a half hours long movie. Another aspect that I did not like was the relationship between Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock and the fact that it doesn't respect the truth. They put Oppenheimer in a bad lighting when, in reality, the timing of the relationship was different.Overall, it's a good movie and it's worth watching (if you have three hours at your disposal).",Positive
"Bringing the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer to the big screen, while also paying careful respect to all parties, was a large task. Christopher Nolan succeeded and this film deserves all the praise that it gets. Yes, it is exhausting to get through, but that is kind of the point.There is not a single bad performance in the bunch. RDJ poured his heart into the role, especially as an old man. Cillian Murphy was crisp and brilliant. Matt Damon was powerful. Emily Blunt was jaw-dropping, specifically in the courtroom scene.While every performance was extraordinary, I'm not sure that every character was necessary. I understand that Nolan wanted to stay true to the source material, but every five minutes there would be an important new name and face. I felt like I needed to take notes on each character.The film does an admirable job of navigating different timelines and the complicated elements of this true story. The pacing really picks up once Matt Damon's character in introduced and kept my attention throughout. That being said, and I hate to say it, but I think that I would have liked the project more as a 4 part series.The film is visually impressive and the score sets the stage throughout. Though the idea of Oppenheimer is larger than life, the movie (much like the lead character) truly succeeds is in the quiet moments.Best Character: Oppenheimer

"Christopher Nolan once again proves his mastery in delivering outstanding films with *Oppenheimer*. Depicting the true story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the creator of the atomic bomb, this film delves deep into the moral and psychological dilemmas faced by a scientist responsible for a major turning point in world history.Visually, *Oppenheimer* is a stunning cinematic work. The use of practical effects, breathtaking cinematography, and the blend of historical elements with fiction create an immersive viewing experience. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is particularly commendable; he captures the complex essence of this character with remarkable depth.With a strong script, gripping sound design, and solid direction from Nolan, *Oppenheimer* is not just an ordinary biopic, but an emotional and intellectual journey. Nolan invites the audience to reflect on the impact of science and human decisions on the future of humanity.",Neutral
"For the first time I watch a 3 hour's documentary without getting bored for a single minute. This movie is a must watch, The story is more than amazing and the cast got the job done. Outstanding performance from each actor on the movie.Christopher Nolan did all the things that make this movie be one of the top rated movies in all histories.Trust me on this that the income of this movie will cross the 500 Million.A must watch movie and I completely recommend it to anyone even if you don't like documentaries trust me that you will like this one and you will enjoy the 3 hours in it.Thank you guys for this Masterpiece.",Positive
"I was excited to see this film, but ended up feeling really disappointed. The overall structure is a convoluted mess. Nolan jumps around in the timeline with his narrative style, which was suited for Interstellar or Inception, but just makes a mess of story in a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb.Firstly, Is it worth seeing? Yes, but there's no reason to rush to the theater and watch in on the big screen. It's mostly a dialogue-driven film, and the big ""boom"" scene isn't impressive. It looks like they just blew up a big stack of dynamite and filmed it. Obviously they couldn't blow up a real nuke just to make a movie, and maybe CGI didn't look good. Either way, the bomb test scene, when it finally gets there, despite seeing it in IMAX, with booming speakers, was underwhelming.Much of the film focuses on the personality of J. Robert Oppenheimer as a flawed person, neither martyr nor warmonger. Cillian Murphy's portrayal is fantastic. However, the plot focuses heavily on the McCarthy-era interrogation he faced where he lost his security clearance, and was subsequently removed from the Atomic Energy Commission. Of course we also see the development of the atomic bomb, and various snippets of Oppenheimer the ""fellow traveler"" (those who were sympathetic to communist and left wing causes but never joined the party), Oppenheimer the womanizer who cheats on his wife, Oppenheimer the clumsy student who isn't as smart as his peers, and finally Oppenheimer the charismatic leader and of some of the most brilliant minds in the world working on the atomic bomb.The follow up to this is all having to do with a more obscure figure in history, named Lewis Strauss, potrayed by Robert Downey, jr. This is where the plot gets lost. Without knowing all the details of Strauss's involvement ahead of time, the whole witch-hunt trial was confusing and convoluted. This part of the story dragged on forever.Now, regarding the historical accuracy, there are lot of famous figures represented in this movie. It's true that Oppenheimer knew all these people, and all these world-famous physicists who, during this strange time in history, were as world reknown as rock stars and entrepreneurs are today. However, they barely say much, they just appear to have a few words while they point Oppenheimer to different people.I also found it odd that Nolan decided to include Einstein, but no mention of how he too was considered a fellow traveler and had more communist affiliations than Oppenheimer, and was briefly subject to some red scare vitriol.I also really questioned the historical accuracy of the whole thing in a particular scene where Oppenheimer is having a tryst with a communist portrayed by Florence Pugh. They start talking about Marx's Capital, how she's read all three volumes. He says ""possession is theft"" and she corrects him ""property is theft"" as supposedly a famous quote from the book. MASSIVE FACEPALM moment.Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about leftist history or Marx, would know that ""Property is Theft"" is a famous slogan from Pierre Joseph-Proudhon, an anarchist who Karl Marx once was friends with, but who he heavily criticized and basically tore apart in subsequent essay. Ever since the collapse of the first international, anarchists and Marxists have not seen eye to eye. No Marxist, let alone a CPUSA member in the 1930's, would be misquoting Marx with Proudhon. This was either a glaring oversight, OR deliberate trolling on the part of Nolan. I'm not sure.Either way, it brings into question the accuracy and the underlying message of the rest of the film. Nolan has included a lot of counter-revolutionary themes in his Dark Knight trilogy, and even hinted at being a closet Tory, so I don't trust him to portray Oppeheimer's saga accurately. I found a lot of similar issues with Aaron Sorkin's dreadful Lucille Ball biopoc. The idea of both films seems to be to ""rescue"" the legacy of these iconic figures by exorcising their communist flirtations as naïve youthful indiscretions. All the while ignoring the reasons why communism was so en vogue in the first half of the 20th century.There are a lot of other issues that I could talk about how general Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon, was made to look like a an gruff but affable ally and good friend of Oppenheimer. By some accounts, they were much more at odds with each other, and some even suspected Groves of being a fascist (people sometimes forget, with all the focus on communist witch hunts, how many fascists and Nazis were in the US at the same time, even in positions of power of prominence). Of course Groves pushed through Oppenheimers security clearance, not because he liked him, or even trusted him, but because he knew that he was their only chance of developing the a-bomb and beggars couldn't afford to play purity politics.Wait til this movie hits streaming to see it, and definitely read some books. Don't take these biopics at face value as real history.",Positive
"This movie gets better the longer you think about it. Everything about the movie is so well done, especially Cillian Murphy's stunning portrayal of Oppenheimer as he realizes what he has done to humanity. The Trinity Test scene was perfectly well done, no horror movie has ever made my heart beat as much as that scene did. Seeing Strauss turn against Oppenheimer was super interesting (RDJ did amazing as him as well). The entire hearing act did a good job at showing how the different motives against Oppenheimer resulted in his downfall. The final scene of the movie is one of the most perfect scenes of any film i've ever seen. Strauss was trying to understand what Oppenheimer said to Einstein that day (assuming it was something to push Einstein against him), but it ended up being something so much more deep. The way the last scene was done was just so chilling and thought provoking, it will stick with you for days after watching it.",Positive
"Oppenheimer was just okay-good. It felt much too rushed at times, much too slow at others, but always forced.Though the acting was stellar, the movie itself was a long, jerky, scattered bio-pic that tried to do a little too much at the expense of being a great.I left feeling too many important themes were just glossed and insufficiently explored for a movie of this magnitude.Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.But it's always cool to see physicists, scientists, and math legends (and their famous egos) get screen time. The star studded cast and their incredible performances was the saving grace, but even they could only do so much to save the awkward pacing and complex themes left on the table, barely touched.",Positive
"I work as an professional editor so from my point of view it was a terrible long movie but funny enough it still was almost too short to tell the full story.. They should and could easily have made it into a series with 5-6 episodes instead of trying to forcefully edit a crazy amount of dialogues from one scene to another - and with no breaks and pauses between the scenes for most parts. We only get the pause to digest the huge amount of fast pace-dialogues when the bomb is about to blow up.. I suspect that the movie was originally longer, and that they were ordered to trim it down to meet the cinematic requirements.. - Or maybe Nolan just lost his touch? Tenet was a complete disaster and know this? Someone working close to him needs to ""check him"" and tell him to maybe take a step backwards and keep it more simple.. More is not always better.",Negative
"Greetings again from the darkness. As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening.Prepare yourself. At a full three hours in length, Nolan's film is a hefty undertaking for viewers. It demands full focus and attention to details and nuance, as you spend significant time listening to brilliant men talk amongst themselves. Nolan adapted the screenplay from the 2005 biography, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer"", written by Kai Bird and Martin Sherman. The end result is a film centered on complex physics and mathematics, yet presented in a simplified manner such that it's much more a character study than a science class. The key is what characters say to each other, how they say it, and how they debate and rationalize the morality of the objective ... building a bomb designed to kill people.The morality of The Manhattan Project is under the microscope here, as is the motivation and concern of Oppenheimer. We get some early background establishing him as an upcoming mind in the world of physics from his academic stops around the globe. Some know Cillian Murphy from ""Peaky Blinders"" or as Scarecrow in Nolan's Batman movies. I'd also recommend a couple of Murphy's underrated gems: FREE FIRE (2016) and RED EYE (2005). It's hard to overstate how spot on Murphy is as Oppenheimer. He lost weight for the role and captures the distinctive movements and speech patterns, as well as the familiar poses and deep-in-thought eyes. We never once question whether this is Oppenheimer, the leader of the science team at the Los Alamos Lab and the Father of the Atomic bomb ... the one who ""sees beyond the world we live in.""
Once Major Groves (Oscar winner Matt Damon) recruits Oppenheimer to run and assemble the great scientific minds, the obvious question to those involved is ... even if we can create this bomb, should we do it? This weighs heavily on Oppenheimer - a man so engulfed by science that his haunting visions are that of atoms and particles and experimental reactions (perhaps a bit too heavy in the first act). Groves is the military leader of the project and the liaison between the scientists, the military, and the government. It's also clear that while Oppenheimer's brilliance is recognized and necessary to the project, almost no one outside of the scientists trusts him. This is where antisemitism and fears of communism arise. Oppenheimer was Jewish and, though he never joined the communist party, was associated with many who did. This included his love interest, Psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (the fabulous rising star Florence Pugh), his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold).The teamwork and stress involved with building the bomb in Los Alamos is conveyed as rooms full of brilliant minds determine the future path of the country and the world. This culminates in the stunning sequence of The Trinity Test near Alamogordo. A blending of complete silence, along with spectacular sound and light, is truly a technical highlight of the film. The initial celebration of success initially overshadows the true meaning ... the bomb is now ready for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing two hundred thousand people and essentially ending WWII, less than four years after the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese (never mentioned here).The bombings are heard via radio news reports, and it's at this point where the weight of what the scientists have done is fully realized. Oppenheimer became a national hero and his Time Magazine cover proves it. A meeting with President Harry S Truman (Oscar winner Gary Oldman sporting a Missouri accent) doesn't go well, as Oppenheimer is introduced to political gamesmanship, something he would face even more directly in the near future. Lewis Strauss (Oscar winner Robert Downey Jr) is a key player as chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, and through him, we witness ego, ambition, and petty behavior that leads to a level of vindictiveness typically only seen at the junior high level.Multiple timelines are covered. There is the background information on Oppenheimer's early years, his well-rounded academia, his love life (lives), his building of the Los Alamos lab team, the overseeing of the bomb development, his time as a hero, the later backroom kangaroo court designed to disgrace him, and Strauss' Senate Confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce. All of these tie together, and it's those final two that make up the last act of the film - giving us a taste of just how nasty politics was 70 years ago (not unlike these days).Nolan has assembled a deep cast with numerous Oscar winners and a roster of talented actors. Among the familiar faces not already named above are: Oscar winner Kenneth Branagh as Danish Physicist Neils Bohr, Oscar winner Rami Malek as experimental physicist David Hill, Oscar winner Casey Affleck as Military security advisor Boris Pash, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Benny Safdie, Dane DeHaan, Jason Clarke, Josh Hartnett, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, Scott Grimes, Tony Goldwyn, James D'Arcy, James Urbaniak, Olivia Thirlby, James Remar, and (Nolan regular) David Dastmalchian.The film is a historical biopic and also an unconventional thriller. Is this about unparalleled advancement in science or is it about the moral dilemma of mass destruction and death? Politics, military, ego, power, science, love, revenge, and redemption are all displayed as Oppenheimer struggles with the power he has created and the lack of power in how it's used. My favorite line in the film is aimed at Oppenheimer when someone informs him that he's now ""not just self-important, but actually important."" The stakes are clear during the test when it's stated that there is a ""near zero"" chance of destroying the world.Cillian Murphy is a shoe-in for a Best Actor nomination, and his performance mesmerizes us. It's nice to see Robert Downey Jr remind us of his true talent, and he should be rewarded with a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, in the only two substantive women roles, should both receive consideration as well. Pugh's role is limited but memorable, while Blunt shines in her best scene during the security hearing.Christopher Nolan has delivered near perfection in technical movie-making, and on top of that, the story and characters are real life, and the performances are top notch. His use of Black & White film for Strauss' perspective allows the viewer to differentiate the Oppenheimer viewpoint. Impressively, while there are some visual effects, Nolan has stated that no CGI was used in the film, and that's most evident in the relatively short closing credit roll - where we typically get dozens if not hundreds of technical experts listed. Ludwig Goransson's (Oscar winner for BLACK PANTHER) score packs an emotional punch, and Jennifer Lame's editing is excellent and vital. Lastly, cinematographer (and regular Nolan collaborator) Hoyte Van Hoytema drives home the power of smart men in a room, as well as the devastation of the bomb test. This is excellent filmmaking and a reminder that the only thing we love more than lifting new heroes onto the pedestal of worship is tearing down those same heroes with a dose of humility. These types of movies rarely get produced these days, so here's hoping enough people go back to the theater to see it to inspire more filmmakers to take a shot.Opened nationally July 21, 2023.",Positive
"Like the headline says this film had a lot of heart and it treats each character with care and Nolan writes them very well. I haven't been able to connect this much to a Nolan character since Interstellar.Another thing I have to praise is the cinematography from Hoyte Van Hoytema is amazing as per usual he always delivers and this is no different.Nolan's direction is very thought out in terms of blocking and where he decides to place the character. And I think his direction goes very hand in hand with the writing. Also, another thing that goes hand in hand with the writing is the editing from Jennifer Lame who is an amazing editor, and I think this is some of her best work.Every performance is amazing. And every actor delivers something interesting to each character. Some stand out performances are obviously Cillian Murphy & Florence Pugh. I never was really interested a Cillian fan but this definitely changed my mind, and I knew Florence was an amazing actress since I saw Midsommar, I would definitely check her out in A Good Person which was amazing as well.Overall great film!",Positive
"I want to thanks to Chritoper Nolan that make this film be perfect. I have just knew that Robert Oppenheim is a man which make the atom bomb. This story in this film also make me speechless because I was influenced not to leave a single sentence on the screen. The bomb explosion is also very realistic, maybe that's what differentiates Nolan compared to other directors who prefer to use CGI. This film also tells about complex matters regarding life decisions taken by Oppenheimer, I like Oppenheimer's life principles without mentioning other stories. Thanks to C. Nolan for this very beautiful film.",Neutral
"In my opinion, films exist not only to educate people and to teach and remember history so that we don't make the same mistakes again and again. In my opinion, films exist to entertain people and give them a unique experience.This film was an emotional roller coaster, and I have rarely experienced such truly outstanding moments.Visually, sound-wise and historically, Oppenheimer is a milestone in cinema history and had me pressed into my seat from start to finish, even my watch often informed me that my pulse was beating at over 140BPM, So pay attention to your breathing because this film will literally take your breath away in one scene or another.",Neutral
"What an fantastic movie. It was the most anticipated movie (after Christopher Nolan announcement) and Nolan has delivered the gem. His direction, camera shots and sound was perfect at each and every moment. Watched it 1st day 1st show. Top notch acting by everyone and you will get to know the story of what Sir Julius Robert Oppenheimer had gone throughout the years (right from the recruitment for the project). Though he believed in himself and his intuitions that he will win not today but someday. After so many years of dedication towards the cinema Cillian Murphy has given fantabulous performance and right judge for the role.",Positive
"The movie is great, the scenes are beautiful. But the screenplay is a really slow burn & often times it falls a bit flat. I guess Nolan went for the character exploration at an emotional level. It sometimes hits, but in the end it falls sort of flat.Its a lot to take in so I think it should have been split into two instead of going for such a long drag. The ending is also not very rewarding for the viewers unlike his other previous ones like the Batman trilogy or Interstellar or even inception.I think its over-hyped. The acting is top notch no doubt about it but the screenplay & pacing is really tedious & jumpy.",Positive
"A phenomenal watch. It may seem too long but once you are in, you forget everything and the focus is on Murphy. Nolan has given yet another masterpiece. Sound design was fabulous even though there were times when dialogues was overpowered by music.The movie takes you on a journey of Robert Oppenheimer and oh my, it was just amazing.The casting choices were nothing short of brilliant. Christian Bale's portrayal of Oppenheimer was nothing less than extraordinary. He captured the essence of the enigmatic scientist, showcasing his brilliance and inner conflict with remarkable depth and nuance. The supporting cast, including talented actors like Emily Blunt, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Cillian Murphy, delivered performances that were equally captivating and added layers of complexity to the narrative.",Positive
"I have to admit: Oppenheimer didn't live up to the hype for me. This is not a bad film per se and while it depicts a frightening turning point in history, its style didn't suit me.Overall I think it's too densely packed and there isn't a payoff for the 3-hour runtime. I didn't feel emotionally connected to any of the characters because they are underdeveloped. There are different timelines, subjects and characters that get introduced and are gone before we get to known or care for them. Plus, the movie is overly dialogue-heavy and politically oriented for its own good. I enjoy engaging conversations but it's filled with technical dialogue, hearings and bureaucracy, which doesn't work for me. I might as well read a book or a Wikipedia page.I will, however, praise the acting of the entire cast and the immersive score and sound design. I wish I could say the same about the visual effects but I found what we were presented underwhelming.",Positive
"I studied Quantum Physics and I knew Oppenheimer biography before watching this movie so expectations were high. Unfortunately, full 3 hours do not make this much better than trailer - I learned nothing new. Outstanding acting from Cillian Murphy and RDJ, Emily was just blunt, so was Matt Damon's performance. Soundtrack is mediocre although delayed explosion sound made few people jump from their seats. Bomb making is virtually non-existent and there is a a lot of chat in the film, typical for a documentary. If you are late 1 hour for cinema screening, you won't miss anything it is that bad. I probably will never watch this again.",Negative
"Patience growing thin! Dunkirk-Ok, Tenet-Really, Oppie-Oh Come on!.Fan of Nolan but seriously as a Non-American, it does not concern me. Where is the 'entertainment' element here??I am not bothered with what US of A did with their brilliance as it has never reflected herself to be a just country.All the actors did an outstanding job but after 3 hours if Russel Crowe asked me then no, I am not entertained!Don't care if its art or biopic or whatever.Also, the back and forth timeline is not appealing anymore.....its time to let time flow as usual now!I think Nolan takes a back seat for now while Guy Ritchie goes ahead!",Negative
"This film, which is based on the Pulitzer Prize winning book American Prometheus, details the life of theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer and follows his early life, as well as the creation and aftermath of the atomic bomb. Overall due to an unbelievable ensemble cast and magnificent lead performance by Murphy, and surprisingly stupendous supporting performance by Damon, heart pounding score, perfectly paced transitions, and stunning visuals, this movie is expertly crafted by Nolan and very enjoyable and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, which is an insane statement for a courtroom drama focusing on the ethics and politics of war.",Positive
"Oppenheimer is set during World War II. J. Robert Oppenheimer is appointed to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. He and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work come to an end on July 16, 1945 when they witness the worlds first nuclear explosion forever changing the course of history.The theme that I feel fits this movie the beset if the consequences of scientific innovation. You can see this in the end of the film when they see the affects of the atomic bomb that is set off. You see the consequences of wilding power and the importance fo learning from history's lessons.Oppenheimer is played by Cillian Murphy to prepare for his role Cillian read and listened to Oppenheimer's lectures. This helped him to be a great actor for his role. If you enjoyed this film, the film A Beautiful mind is a similar to Oppenheimer.",Positive
"In a revelation that history books have overlooked, ""Oppenheimer"" brilliantly portrays the vital role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in ending World War II. The film delves into his profound stance on mass destruction weapons and their global impact. Once again, Christopher Nolan impresses the audience with exceptional sound mixing, cinematography, and a compelling script. Though the film begins slowly with numerous character introductions and politics, it culminates in a harmonious and thought-provoking finale. Not being a history buff myself, the movie ignited a genuine curiosity about Oppenheimer, demonstrating the power of cinema to spark interest and conversation. A special shoutout to Cillian Murphy, whose phenomenal acting brings the character to life.",Neutral
"I define the movie as a complete masterpiece. This 3-hour movie includes the process of Nole's making of the atomic bomb and his views on the atomic bomb. It is not overlooked that visual effects were avoided in the movie. A real atomic bomb was used in the movie and visual effects were avoided while it was exploding. The cast is excellent and marvelous. Robert Downey Jr., whom we know from his movies. We have seen that he is still continuing his career in different films. We should not ignore the fact that Nole reflects his views on the atomic bomb to us through emotions in the film. It is sad to know what will happen towards the end of the film. And as we see in the film, some were laughing, some were sad, and most remained silent. The film is both for me. It was a dramatic and exciting movie. I recommend watching the movie. In my opinion, the movie is 10/10.",Positive
"I can't find the right words for the cast..Murphy in particular was exceptional.It blows my mind that isn't shortlisted for VFX nomination, considering what is on that list!For those who found it boring, I guess you haven't watched European films...At laest it wasn't a waste of time like most of the current movies and it is a biography after all.It touches science, morality, war, politics, repercussions, the time frame, power....and of course, CORRUPTION.Personally, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and loved the intense music, which was attaching with my emotions whilst watching. Give it a shot people!And may the Oscar go to Murphy! Though the academy has lost vastly its credibility...just saying..",Positive
"Oppenheimer is a visually stunning film which tells a slow-paced, dialog-heavy story in a delightfully complex, creative, and fast-paced way.Due to the the sensitive subject matter and the fact that it's not entirely uncommon for us Americans too be a little too bombastic about, and proud of, our military conquests and history, going in I was afraid the story might come off a little too triumphant or nationalistic. But this movie intentionally, and successfully, rides a very dichotomous line that leaves you feeling uneasy at best for much of its run time.The juxtaposition between the rooms of people cheering at great scientific achievement and the potential (and hope) for it to end not just WW2 but war *itself*, against the horrific reality of what that scientific achievement could, and eventually *would*, be used for, leaves you a bit frozen. I am, admittedly, a rather sensitive person so while I watched the characters cheer and celebrate their years of hard work as they optimistically looked forward with hope for a better future, I found myself fighting back tears having known exactly what this invention would go on to do, both physically and psychologically. The more cheering I heard, the more disturbed I felt. And as much of the theater laughed at a ""joke"" a character made about not choosing a certain Japanese city to bomb, I (and some others) sat silently and solemnly, unable to laugh. I was overcome with great sorrow as I reflected on the fact that some of the men who were making the decision to drop this bomb were making it all too lightly. As they laughed and celebrated, many of them had no real grasp of the horror they were about to rain down on real people... Cities filled with culture and history... Homes filled with moms, dads, sons, daughters, grandchildren... 200,000+ innocent civilian lives lost through no fault of their own... As the film shows, there were many people who knew exactly what was going on and who were deeply afraid, and even regretful. But history also showed us that some people remained proud and braggadocios, having never fully grasping what they had helped do even after the destruction was done. Even today I still see people posting disturbingly un-empathetic, nationalistic memes laughing at and celebrating this event that caused generations of pain for real people.Much of this movie leaves you feeling unsure about how to feel about Oppenheimer himself--which I think that is the appropriate way to feel. That dichotomy is was makes this movie so great. You want to feel happy because you love science and achievement, you want to feel joy because a horrific war was finally coming to an end for one reason or another, you want to feel sorry for Robert because you know he has to live with this creation and the psychological effects of knowing what it has done and can still do, you want Robert to get justice after what the government put him through. But at the same time you mourn for the loss of life, you mourn for the generations of fear and pain that invention would go on to cause, you reflect on if it was worth it or if it was even necessary at all, you feel anger for the people who participated knowing full well what would happen, you even feel disgust at Oppenheimer himself. You are transported to 1940 and feel a genuine fear in thinking ""well, what IF the allied nations weren't the first to come up with this technology? What IF we were beat to the punch? What IF we never used it? What would have happened?"" while also feeling the experience of what it feels like to be fully human and filled with empathy for other humans, ""but what if the war could have ended without it? And if our enemies are monsters for their disregard for innocent human life in pursuit of their goals, doesn't that make us monsters too? Doesn't an eye for an eye make the world blind?"" Whether fearful or empathetic, all are valid questions, fears, and concerns. This dichotomy and constantly feeling of being stuck between a rock and a hard place is what it means to be human. And it's in that dichotomous space that this movie lives and proves to be a masterpiece.Switching gears briefly; the music, the sound effects, the cinematography, the acting, the wardrobe, the practical effects... it's all wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. They nailed it in so many ways. And let's not forget the fact that Kitty Oppenheimer is a whole mood. Emily Blunt did a wonderful job and I found myself laughing at many of her reactions on screen thinking ""this is actually, probably, the appropriate response."" LOL. And it probably goes without saying that Cillian and Robert Downey Jr were phenomenal. Just a really good experience all in all.And if you have the immense pleasure and privilege of living near one of the 30 theaters (worldwide) that plays this in true IMAX 15perf 70mm film... GO. Seeing this in 70mm film, in 4:3 aspect ratio, on a floor-to-ceiling screen is astounding. You must see it this way if you are a cinema head.",Positive
"A movie about life of Robert Oppenheimer, the focal scientist who helped bring to life the atomic bomb.This was the first movie this year to get me excited to go to back to the movies but this movie ultimately disappointed me in several ways. In the end the negatives outweighed the positives.The good:Fantastic scoreGood acting overall, especially Cillian Murphy is great, so is Robert Downey JrExcellent cinematographyThe bad:
-Story feels disjointed, time jumps are excessive to the point that is dostractingMovie tries to pack too much into theee hour runtime and doesn't get it's priorities right. It feels like a series of ""This happened and then that happened"" scenes and a collage of everything in his life. Several prominent characters get introduced in rapid succession and they are gone before you get to know them or to care in the slightest. On the other hand the movie dedicates too much time to things like the courtroom drama and sex scenesUnnecessary sex and nudity, with all the feminist movement these days and considering we're in 2023, we surely should not put sex acenes and nudity only for the sake of it but only if they add to the plot. Unfortunately in Openheimer's case they don't. We see absolute unnecessary sex and nudity in this film that serve no purpose.One last note, there is no reason to watch this movie in IMAX other than an underwhelming explosion scene that takes a maximum of 10 minutes.Despite being a Nolan fan, I have to give this one a 6 overall.",Positive
"As to not raise expectations this movie sucks, watch it anyway.Historians, PS majors, Americans in general, amazing an a must see.Nolan at his finest.Not as hard to follow as it may seem just keep watching. Movie of the year for me so far, not even close.Don't let the running time dissuade you, before you know it, it'll be over leaving you wanting more.The forethought of Oppenheimer as it pertains to history is incredible for a scientist.I wish I had seen it on the big screen but the running time did dissuade me so on an off Sat. For college football my wife & I threw $20 at Prime to see it at home.Best $20 I've spent this holiday season.Check it out...",Positive
"Oppenheimer tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), creator of the Atomic bomb and the role he played in WWII. Whilst I wasn't familiar with his backstory, I had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the fuss was about.Cast wise, it was packed! However maybe too star-studded to the point where I found myself questioning why certain big-name actors were involved in the film given how little screen time they had. Florence Pugh's character was unnecessary, and whilst she may have meant a lot to Oppenheimer, they could have just referenced her instead. Whilst I personally found Cillian Murphy to be emotionless and monotone, I'm not familiar enough with the real life Oppenheimer to know if that was accurate or not.Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Have strong performances, and Josh Hartnett deserves a special mention for not aging a day since 1998.It's a long film, and there was a lot of dialogue. During some scenes, I felt like I was in a science lecture and had to try not to doze off, and as for the timeline, it was a bit confusing with black-and-white scenes and coloured ones representing various times that didn't make sense.There's no doubting that this film is great, however I just don't think I'm the type of person who would appreciate it in its finest.",Positive
"And the only entertaining part is two hours in when someone ""passes gas.""But seriously, this moving is non-stop science/political jargon without ever pausing to give you a chance to process what you heard. The characters are unrelatable and undeveloped. There is no exposition, no rising action, no climax, and no resolution. It's just monotonous talk-talk *new scene* talk-talk-talk *new scene* talk-talk=talk some more.Gone is the magic of The Prestige, the depth Inception, and the wonder of Interstellar. In its place is pretentions telling, not showing.PS: Why does Florence Pugh not wear clothes at any point during this movie?",Neutral
"Felt like I watched three hours of previews for what should've been a great film. The bouncing timeline was confusing and did nothing for the story.I expected to see something, anything, about the devastation these bombs caused to innocent families, woman, and children. The low budget movie; Einstein and the bomb, was much more informative and entertaining.Casting Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was an insult to even novices of history. Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon delivered uninspiring performances that felt more like cameos offered up for friends of the producers.The exhausting, strewn out Nuremberg trial scenes seemed like an after thought and reeked of ""dramatic interpretation"".The attention this film got followed by the praise given by nervous critics afraid of offending the Hollywood elite was a perfect example of the ""King has no clothes."" Take a pass and watch Barbie, it, at least, won't take two nights to finish 🤷‍♂️",Positive
"In his latest masterpiece, Christopher Nolan brings the life of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer to the big screen with exceptional performances from an ensemble cast. Through astounding visual effects and practical in-camera techniques, Nolan delivers a cinematic experience that immerses viewers into Oppenheimer's world. While requiring multiple viewings to grasp its nuances, Oppenheimer remains a must-watch for cinephiles who appreciate the artistry behind filmmaking. With a perfect balance between hero and villain, the characterization of Oppenheimer tugs at the audience's emotions, leaving them invested throughout the three-hour journey. Despite minor sound mix issues, Nolan's exploration of history and science makes Oppenheimer a thought-provoking and visually spectacular cinematic delight. 🎬",Neutral
"From the very beginning this movie pulls you in and you are left at the edge of your seat the entire 3 hours. First it doesn't feel like 3 hours all. Then the movie will stay with you for weeks afterwards. The timing for a movie like this is perfect as it has been said Sam Altman (the man mostly responsible for this revolution in AI we are all undoubtedly aware of) is a modern Oppenheimer in many ways. Not only this but I felt it was redemption for the man himself.I cannot recommend enough, due to the fact that many people have called this movie (boring) to read up on the manhattan project and J Robert Oppenheimer before watching. Read American Prometheus if you have the time or watch one of the many documentaries. It's worth doing as it enhances the experience even more. Consider the impact such a thing has had on the world. You do that and I just don't understand how anybody could possibly find this movie boring in any way.Cillian Murphy's performance is truly remarkable and he has earned his Oscar for this. In fact the entire cast really are at their best in this film. I thought I'd struggle watching Robert Downey Junior play anything other than Iron Man, let alone the bad guy in any film but he really nailed his role as Strauss. It should be mandatory viewing in my opinion for anyone and I truly cannot recommend this film enough. Christopher Nolan has never really disappointed and this is his masterpiece. I can't wait to see what he does next.",Positive
"Oppenheimer is truly a biographical film with a captivating narrative. The focus is on the characters, and the depiction of nuclear weapon development is minimal. The bombings are not the central theme; rather, it delves into profound introspection. The film employs a significant amount of stream of consciousness, illusions, and auditory suppression to convey Oppenheimer's deep-seated anxiety and unease towards atomic energy. The culmination of events and arguments is stunning, leaving one speechless.The explosion begins from within; time is a mere technique, a means to reach destruction. Politics and human entanglements are superficial. By approaching the biographical aspect from a thriller's perspective, the explosions become silent, ecstasy turns terrifying, and interrogations become more jarring than bombs. The 'chain reaction' may literally mean the destruction of the world, or in another sense, not the end of World War II but the beginning of the Cold War. He witnesses firsthand the deathly inferno he helped create, entwined with both trembling and boundless fascination.In the tumultuous year of 2023, with such a restless movie-watching environment, it is remarkable that a film so composed, serious, slow-paced, and detached from the audience was made with a budget of 100 million dollars. Moreover, the film manages to capture the beauty of physics in real-life shots, a feat perhaps achievable only by someone like Nolan.",Neutral
"An incredible film, I recommend it. Excellent acting, very well crafted plot. It's a good film to make us think about the Second World War as a whole, to make us think about how important the atomic bomb was in ending it. However, the film also shows the risks that this brought to the world after its creation. Everything has a positive and negative side, the film shows this very well and also shows how difficult it can be to make decisions, how difficult it can be to deal with your own influence, how difficult it can be to be at the top and think differently from how the government thinks. . It's a complicated film, you might not understand everything right away, but as the film goes on, things start to fall into place. What I recommend is that after watching the film, research the story, it will open your mind a little more and understand things better.",Positive
"Wow. This movie literally changed my life. I know that might sound like I'm glazing it to the extreme but it really did. Before watching this movie i was not very fond of American history let alone any history at all. I never really cared about who invented the light bulb, the toaster, the microwave, and i definitely never thought id care about who invented the atomic bomb. However, this movie sparked a passion in me that i didn't even know existed. I found myself on google the moment after any character was named researching on who they were. What role did they play in history? How did they affect the creative process of the atomic bomb? Who is Edward teller? This movie left me on edge and curious throughout the entire time. Eager to learn. I even found myself researching the science. I have never been so drawn into a non fiction movie in my entire life. J. Robert Oppenheimer was quite the interesting person and this movie tells his story flawlessly. I had goosebumps thinking about what was going through his head the entire time. This is a must watch.",Neutral
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023) is a powerful biographical drama that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist behind the atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy delivers a remarkable performance, capturing Oppenheimer's brilliance and moral turmoil. Nolan's direction, marked by a non-linear narrative, provides a deep exploration of Oppenheimer's personal and professional struggles. The film balances historical accuracy with dramatic intensity, examining the ethical implications of nuclear weapons. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography and Ludwig Göransson's haunting score enhance the film's immersive experience. Oppenheimer is a profound exploration of science, ethics, and legacy, reflecting on the complex impact of its protagonist's achievements.",Neutral
"With great expectations, I went to watch this film, and returned home totally disappointed. Very much shallow plotted with so many people to remember. I don't prefer watching this at theater. Many of us intended to leave in the middle while the movie was running. To me, it is a overhyped movie. However cinematography and casting were good. I expected better from Mr. Nolan. This movie could have ended within 1 hour and 20 minutes. At this point of time, movies should have had some points which will hook the audience. But I did not find anything like that in this movie. I should have watched Barbie instead. Nevertheless, best of luck.",Positive
"Christopher Nolan does it again! Oppenheimer*battles toe-to-toe with ""Interstellar"" as my favorite Nolan film. His storytelling ability is remarkable, and he masterfully assembles a stellar cast that elevates the material. Every single one of the main actors delivers incredible performances deserving of Oscar nominations, but Cillian Murphy truly takes it to another level. The performances are sublime-engaging, thought-provoking, and relatable. You feel a whirlwind of emotions: anger, desperation, and frustration, but above all, a strong desire to help and root for Oppenheimer, a man ahead of his time, misunderstood, and cast aside when his talents were no longer needed. The visuals are stunning, from the breathtaking explosion of the atomic bomb to the poignant black-and-white scenes that evoke a ""Schindler's List"" vibe at times. The biggest compliment I can give this film is that, despite its three-hour runtime, it felt surprisingly short-a remarkable achievement that few movies can pull off. Overall, Oppenheimer is a cinematic triumph that will resonate with audiences long after the credits roll.",Neutral
"Nolan fails at a very basic but important technique in film. ""SHOW, don't tell"".They do a lot of talking in this film about the decisions, actions and the results of what goes on in the film - but what makes the audience relate to what's going on unless you actually show the danger and the horror? Is this film made to make you think? Then they need to deliver properly. People get a HINT of the danger of the bomb but merely do clever politics around it. I'm quite disappointed in such a slow burn of a movie. What's more interesting? SEEING the results of the characters or just hearing about them in fast cuts? You decide. I love long discussions too and mindplay.Actors are great.. Cinematography is great. Score is great and the story is fantastic. The execution is just lazy and low budget.",Positive
"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles. Remember not all that shines is gold.",Positive
"A three-hour-long movie, with over 80% of its plot centered around discussions at a table, filled with dialogues, not about how to make an atomic bomb, but entirely focused on politics and arguments, devoid of action sequences, and might even say, lacking a coherent storyline.If I were watching this kind of dialogue-driven plot on a streaming platform, I would likely skip through it. However, because I was in a cinema, I found myself dozing off several times.The plot unfolds within these debates, and all the scenes are quite fragmented, with each segment lasting just one or two minutes. The scene transitions are incredibly rapid, and there is no overarching narrative. The only semblance of continuity is Oppenheimer's extramarital affair, but in reality, this love affair is somewhat irrelevant to the movie.As for Oppenheimer's inner journey and his torment and ambivalence regarding inventing the atomic bomb, I must say it was hard to empathize. Due to the lack of a complete storyline, it's challenging to connect with these characters, making it difficult to immerse oneself and truly understand Oppenheimer's emotional experiences. In comparison, similar biographical films like ""The Social Network,"" which also employ a debate-driven narrative, and ""The Imitation Game"" are clearly superior and not as chaotic as this movie.",Positive
"Oppenheimer was an amazing surprise! I wasn't super exited for the release of even for Oppenheimer at all, and honestly I get now why people were actually loving this movie.My only critic is that it's a very long movie, but I don't think there could be a shorten version of it so I guess I personally think it's a movie to be watched at home. For me of course, it's a movie of reflection and so you capture the message you need to watch at least for the first time in your time.I loved it , Cillian Murphy's acting is magnificent and no one else could capture the deep of the character besides him. He rocked!Everything about this movie is admirable and lovable. RDJ is amazing too and Emily blunt too. For some reason people were telling me that the movie was too much talking and no action and honestly when it comes to this I'm the first one to critic, but in this case it was honestly amazing the way they did it.They would be no other way to create tension and make us understand history in general without that conversations, so I highly disagree. And honestly, in the beginning, it feels a little uncomfortable because of all of the physics talking and I wasn't understanding anything so it was almost like I was watching Top Gun for the first time (lol my reference sucked) I need to get in this world and understand everything, so I would if you actually in there.Which brings me to the fact that they actually made me feel like the weight of the world was in my shoulders for a movie to make you feel this way it's got to be good. Christopher Nolan was on point, and the cinematography of the movie is magic. The whole metaphor with Prometeu and the fire was so on point, and I honestly had a lot of empathy for Robert.I loved Einstein in the movie. I felt like his connection with Oppenheimer was such a unique one and there were times that we could honestly feel what open Heimer was feeling and this was just an out of body experience for me.Sometimes I have a problem to connect to male characters, because I'm a female and experiences are different and in general sometimes I don't feel like watching a whole man movie. But this movie was something different in that story, probably because it's based on real life stuff, but it was honestly amazing.Cillian Murphy needs to be given an Oscar for this!!!! The make up to age him was pretty good too. Loved it! Too long though lol.",Positive
"""Oppenheimer,"" a thought-provoking documentary, delves into the intricate life and enduring legacy of a key figure in the scientific world. The film seamlessly combines historical footage, interviews, and dramatized scenes to paint a nuanced picture of the individual at the center of the atomic age.Structured chronologically, the documentary takes the audience through the formative years of the scientist, tracing the trajectory of his career against the backdrop of a world engulfed in geopolitical tensions. The film effectively captures the moral quandaries faced by the scientific community during the development of the atomic bomb, shedding light on the complex interplay between intellect, ambition, and ethical responsibility.The casting choices contribute to the documentary's authenticity, with the lead actor delivering a compelling portrayal of the central figure. The supporting cast further enhances the narrative, embodying key historical figures and providing a well-rounded view of the socio-political context.Visually, the film is a triumph, seamlessly blending archival footage with carefully crafted reenactments. The attention to period details in cinematography and production design transports viewers to the era, immersing them in the scientific and political landscape of the time.While the documentary excels in its comprehensive exploration of the scientific and geopolitical aspects, some may find the pacing a bit slow, particularly during in-depth scientific explanations. Additionally, a more profound exploration of the personal life of the central figure and a deeper examination of the aftermath of the atomic bombings could have added further dimensions to the narrative.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a well-executed documentary that invites audiences to contemplate the complexities surrounding scientific innovation, moral responsibility, and the far-reaching consequences of groundbreaking discoveries. Without delving into specific names, the film remains a captivating exploration of the human side of scientific achievement, leaving viewers with a lingering contemplation of the ethical implications of technological advancements in the context of war.",Neutral
"Christopher Nolan's (The Dark Knight, Tenet, Inception) latest biopic Oppenheimer follows the father of the atom bomb J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) throughout his early years as a physics student, his time as the head of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, and various other key moments in ""Oppies"" (as his friends called him) lifetime. The film explores the moral implications of the Pandora's box humanity unlocked in the New Mexico desert and Oppenheimer's struggles to come to terms with his role in fashioning the key.As a fan of other Nolan films, you may already know that his movies require one's complete attention. Nolan does not treat his viewers as if they need everything explained to them. His movies are often more cerebral than the usual popcorn flick, and this one arguably is his most intellectual by far. If you go into this movie expecting the gun fights and action of Tenet or Inception, you may be disappointed. This is a biopic, not an action movie. This is not to say that it is a bad film; on the contrary, it is a great one. Just be aware that it is more a historical drama rather than an action movie.In fact, despite its hefty three-hour run time, the film maintains Nolan's signature relentless pacing that keeps the audience engaged throughout. Even during scenes where characters are simply talking, the audience is invested. In the hands of a lesser group of filmmakers, this feat would be difficult to pull off. Here the director, the screenwriters, the score, and a huge cast of talented actors and individuals come together to make it look easy.Throughout the course of the film, we get to meet all those who impacted Oppie's life, not always for the better. There are his love interests, friends, enemies, and frenemies. Every role is played to near perfection. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is particularly impressive, as he depicts a brilliant but flawed man. The supporting cast is also noteworthy, with too many great actors to name them all. Emily Blunt portrays Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, while Matt Damon plays Leslie Groves, the military man responsible for recruiting Oppenheimer and other scientists to the Manhattan Project. Robert Downey Jr. Also makes an appearance as Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss.The film primarily focuses on the extraordinary efforts made by America to develop the atomic bomb before the Germans and Russians during World War Two and the Cold War, respectively. The editing and direction of the film are masterfully done, creating a sense of urgency that keeps the audience engaged throughout. As with all of Nolan's films, sound plays a crucial role in creating the mood and atmosphere for the audience. At times, the sound and score can be overwhelming, which is intentional as it mirrors Oppenheimer's feelings of being overwhelmed with the reality of what his efforts have brought to fruition.Summing up the entire lifetime of such a complex figure as Oppenheimer in just three hours is quite a task. However, this film is a testament to how it can be done masterfully. If you are even slightly interested in this film, I highly recommend giving it a shot. I don't think you will be disappointed.",Positive
"Three hours doesn't feel that long when you watch a great movie with solid plot and great acting overall. Having 3 oscar winner as cameos makes it feel more amazing. However i think the nude scene isn't really necesarry nor adding something crusial to the plot.Half of this movie is something related with quantum physic and the rest all about law and politic. However if you aren't into those things, you can still understand and enjoy the movies.All actors are charming and convinced as they potrayed the role, but emily blunt perfomance is the one that attract me the most. I hope she can win oscar next year.",Positive
"The actual story needed to be told. But it would have been better a 2 hour linear docudrama, than a 3 hour mysterious storytelling adventure where the director keeps us in his thrall with his cutting, and his use of color to depict time. The science, which is actually the most important character in the story, is almost totally excluded. The scenes meant to describe fission processes, were not related to fission at all. Dark stars aren't relevant. Neither is the physics of how stars work, because stars work by fusion, and this is a story about fission. The atomic bomb was inevitable, given the continuing discoveries by nuclear physicists. A few years There was a time, shortly before the Manhattan project was funded, the we didn't know if it could work, theoretically. But that wasn't made a part of the Oppenheimer story. Churchill's refusal to share with the Russians thru into the Cold War sill are threatened by.",Neutral
"Everybody involved with the production of 'Oppenheimer (2023)' is working at the highest conceivable level, practicing their craft so adeptly that it's hard to express just how impressive their efforts truly are. There isn't a weak link in the entire chain; everything is at the highest standard imaginable. The writing, the directing, the editing, the score, the cinematography, the sound design, the special effects, the costuming, the set design, the casting, and the acting - oh, the acting - is all impeccable. This film is exactly what it was always intended to be. If it doesn't clean up at the Oscars, I'll eat my shoe* or, more realistically, I'll be very surprised.However, that doesn't mean it's perfect. More specifically, it doesn't mean it moves me enough to declare it one of the best movies ever made (as so many others seem to have). It isn't even Nolan's best, although there is a good argument to be made that it's his most accomplished. Essentially, the dilemma at play here is that this is undeniably prestige filmmaking that's pretty much technically flawless, but it's just missing that intangible oomph to catapult it into any of my all-timer lists.Some of its weak points, most - if not all - of which are choices rather than mistakes, are as follows: the sound mixing, while markedly improved from 'Tenet (2020)', is balanced so it favours music and sound effects over dialogue, which is fine and dandy for the big explosion-type stuff but is sometimes irritating when it comes to the quieter dialogue-driven scenes (which take up 80% of the runtime); the editing is pretty relentless and the entire affair feels a bit like a trailer, which in turn makes the feature feel even longer than it already is (at three hours, that's not something you want) and can sometimes keep you at a bit of a distance from the narrative; the opening is quite underwhelming because it feels more like a rote history lesson than an actual story and is far more generic than the movements it precedes (thankfully it isn't too long before the flick finds its feet); sometimes, the actual mechanics of what's going on get lost in the background and, as such, the Manhattan Project almost feels ancillary to the narrative's exploration of the politics surrounding the protagonist's vague association with the communist party; the picture doesn't delve into Oppenheimer's psyche as much as it should considering that the sequences in which it does are easily the most successful in the entire affair; and the female representation is noticeably really weak across the board, with Florence Pugh's well-performed but perfunctory character - as crude as it sounds - only really existing to show her breasts and give the male hero something to feel guilty about.Having said that, there are plenty of things to like here (as my first paragraph ought to suggest). Nolan's never been an especially formalistic filmmaker when it comes to specific scenes and the way in which they're crafted, as his formalistic achievements are usually reserved for the ways in which he structures his films (i.e. How he plays around with chronology to, for instance, create a sense of escalating tension or put you in the headspace of the protagonist). That's true of this picture, too, but here he also tries his hand at some notably fanciful sequences that utilise surrealist elements to further enhance the feeling they're intended to provoke (and, in some cases, represent). One of these scenes, in particular, even outshines the inevitable trinity test, which is itself a masterclass in ratcheting tension and explosive payoffs (pun intended). That this artistic moment prevents the movie's most obvious attraction - the impact of which can be measured not in kilotons, but in megatons - from being the actual highlight of the overall affair is a testament to the sheer success of Nolan's directorial decisions. That's not to downplay the tangible awe inspired by the dropping of the bomb in New Mexico, which truly is a sight (and sound) to behold. It's incredibly impressive that the effects were mainly captured in camera, using a variety of techniques such as miniature photography and full scale pyrotechnics. The sound (or, at least, some of it) was also apparently not recreated in a studio but recorded on set. For how almost nonchalantly these visceral elements are presented, appearing as just another part of the world crafted for the overall immersive experience, they're undoubtedly and almost unimaginably astounding.The film is a veritable who's who of Hollywood: almost every character who pops up, no matter how small their role in the overall story, is portrayed by someone recognisable. There are more stars in this thing than in the night sky and the acting is absolutely brilliant across the board. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Benny Safdie, Tom Conti, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke and David Krumholtz are highlights, but Robert Downey Jr. Is an awards-worthy standout who comes second only to the picture's phenomenal leading man. Cillian Murphy commands the screen with his understated yet powerhouse performance, carrying the weight of the atomic-sized affair with ease. If he doesn't win the Best Leading Actor Oscar, there's something seriously wrong.Even at three hours in length, there really isn't all that much filler. Perhaps it's because of the way it's edited, but it feels as though the events it depicts have actually been somewhat truncated to fit the runtime. Sometimes, it feels as though it's been on for longer than it actually has simply because it crams so much into its duration. On the flip side, huge chunks of it also occasionally zip by in what seems to be an instant. The pacing doesn't leave much breathing room, which ensures there's never a dull moment - at the cost of there never really being time to fully digest what's happening in any given scene (it actually doesn't even feel as though there are individual scenes, per se). Even though it is arguably a bit too long, it's also hard to pinpoint exactly what ought to have been removed to reduce its length. It tells its story in a fairly efficient way and features a number of key turning points that prevent it from ever feeling stale. It's often really compelling and, although it obviously has segments that are far more successful than others, it's generally engaging even during its driest moments. It helps that it's a fairly nuanced exploration of its heavy topic, dancing through the moral minefield of its subject matter without ever pushing its own opinion on its audience. It knows there are no easy answers and, by pushing you to confront your own feelings on the issue and perhaps even attempt to decipher what you'd do in the same situation, it manages to convey somewhat of an understanding of the absolute impossibility of the situation it depicts. It creates a great deal of empathy for its protagonist, someone who is easy to blame for the atrocities committed with the weapon he is credited as being the father of, without attempting to absolve him. It might make you reconsider your opinion of him, but it definitely doesn't force you to.In the end, though, this does lack that hard-to-identify element that would make it really resonate with me. I can't quite say what it is, but something stops it from truly hitting me in my core. It isn't all that emotionally affecting and sometimes it isn't wholly gripping. It's often thrilling, but it doesn't quite sink its hooks into you enough to stay with you for long after it's over. I'm not pining to watch it again and I don't think it will remain seared in my brain for too long. It's great, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't quite rise to the standard of Nolan's best work, even if there's an argument to be made that it's his most accomplished.*I definitely won't be eating my shoe, no matter what happens at the Oscars. Who do you think I am? Werner Herzog?",Positive
"The movie is well directed but somehow the topic seems completely irrelevant. Robert Oppenheimer no doubt did a miracle (biggest curse on mankind, actually) by inventing atomic bomb but do we really require movie on legal events unfolding after the bombing event. Don't think these legal tangles and all are so important in course of history that movie is made out of it. The movies is unnecessarily 3 hours long and sometimes it feels that there is no point in knowing so insignificant events which happened post bombing event. Rather more focus on bomb invention and events leading bomb invention would have been an interesting event.I am perplexed to see so many high reviews about the movie. But I find it pretty average and one would not miss anything in life if he or she skips this movie.What I feel Mr. Chirstopher Nolan is losing its streak actually. Nolan was one of my favourite story teller but with every passing movie I am losing interest in his movies. Batman, Inception, Interstellar were absolute marvels and all time favourites of mine. But then Dunkrik, Tenet and Oppenheimer happend and I feeling his losing his touch on path breaking genre of movies. I feel less and less inclined now a days to watch his movies precisely because of dull topics he selects for story telling. He needs to reinvent himself now and come out with something unique and interesting. He needs to set bar higher than Interstellar.",Neutral
"This is my first review ever and as a big Nolan fan I have never come to write any on some of his other phenominal films but I have finally decided to write a short review to highlight Oppenheimers work of art.To start with, Cillian Murphy is just excellent and is everything I hoped for - he truly embodied J. Robert Oppenheimer. R. D. J. After many years in the Marvel universe has returned with a bang! Matt Damon was also great and I particularly enjoyed Murphy's and Damon's character dynamics and dialogues together.The dense screenplay is oscar worthy. The film however is quite dialogue heavy but is made up for by the breathtaking cinematography and the well-written script.Lastly, I have always believed that music is what moves us emotionally during a film. Ludwig Göransson has yet again created an absolutely thrilling and suspenseful score thats flows extremely well with the films pace and aura. These are my personal favourites - give them a listen if you haven't already!: ""Can You Hear The Music"", ""Meeting Kitty"", ""Manhattan Project"", ""American Prometheus"", ""Trinity"", ""Something More Important"", ""Destroyer of Worlds"", ""Oppenheimer"".And yes... Of course I am writing this review whilst listening to the soundtrack.",Positive
"Like many this weekend, I spend it in a pact theatre watching one of the most hyped-up movies this summer. Unfortunately for me, not only was the theatre packed but the air-conditioning was out of order too, so it got warm and humid in there quick. If it weren't for this, I could tell whether some of the people in the audience left the movie because they weren't interested (in particular - there were a pair of girls next to me whom kept checking their phones - I counted six instances before they left around the time Jean Tatlock died. I didn't check the time so I can't tell how far into the movie that was) or due to the heat in the theater.The movie itself didn't meet up my expectations but I still managed to enjoy it. Does that mean my expectations are too high or did the movie simply not appeal to me? Well, let's try to answer that by discussing for whom this movie is - in other words, what's the prototype of the viewer this movie is build for. I think it would be best to start by quickly describing what the movie is about but here we meet our first challenge - I'm not confident enough to say that this movie is primarily about Oppenheimer and his quest to build the atomic bomb. No, this movie is more of a court drama with a backstory presented in stretched flashback and an epilogue under a veil of overwhelming drama but the movie also has nods to multiple conspiracy theories that were popular at the present time. The movie also mentions various other impactful events, like the McCartney anti-communist program that requires some context to grasp the the impact it has on Oppenheimer and the connections the links to communism (Elizabeth Cox case, for example) and I feel like context around Lewis Strauss is also important in order to decode some of the messages to fully understand the gravity of the situation. So it seems that the movie is all over the place with some links that require a specific cultural capital to connect all the dots. Having that in mind, I can only determine that this movie is build for those who have a wide understanding of the US history, especially regarding the context of the Manhattan project and the discourse that followed it.One thing that did bother me quite a lot was the portrait of a scientist and the science community that this movie attempts to push. It's in no ways a negative connotation but it isn't a honest one either as it's the most evident signifier of commercialization - to say it mildly, every one that represented science in some way was presented as a witty fellow that spends most of his time talking, discussing theoretical phenomena and coming to the conclusions on the dot. At a certain point doing the movie, there was a critical remark suggesting that Oppenheimer stopped being a physicist a while ago and he's more of a politician now. To some extent, I'd have to agree because most of the scientist were portrayed more like politicians. Apart from the basic quantum mechanics principles and paradoxes that we're mentioned early in the movie, most of the scientific discourse didn't have a clear message to connotate it's magnitude.On the flipside, I loved the idea how the creation of the atomic bomb in way did start off the chain event that will lead to the destruction of the world. The whole discourse regarding the moral and the philosophical consequences of the atomic bomb after the successful test was just magnificent and in a way that's when the real movie has started for me. The scenes with exquisite sound design and hallucination-like visuals of how the people in the room from Oppenheimer's perspective might look under the atomic blast were breathtaking. The ideas of having blood on your hand just for taking part in creating a weapon of mass-destruction are mind-boggling. And the visuals, the visuals at certain scenes do deserve all the praise. Although the story took too many ""off-road"" turns, at least in my opinion, I still want to commend the story to be rather comprehensible, even though it wasn't linear at all and had multiple jumps in time. After just one watch I can't tell whether the switch from color to black & white scenes helped to grasp the time jumps or not, perhaps it's just the room or surrounding or the context itself that helped connect the timeline in order, but the presentation in such of the story in such a way did help me to understand the story just a little bit better, leaving only the questions in context behind.Overall, I can't say this is a bad movie in any way possible but I can't say that I particularly liked it either. The hype for the movie was real - whether it was reddit post showcasing the massive film reel of this movie or early film reviewers portraying this movie as an important landmark in cinema - but I feel the hype also ruined the movie for me a bit as I definitely didn't meet the expectations it set off for me. At the end of the day, I'm just happy most movie snobs and just casual movie viewers can enjoy and appreciate this as a cinema marvel. Even though I don't fall into that category, I must admit that the general discourse surrounding this movie does make me happy and the fact that it made a lot of people look into such an influential figure in modern history is great too.",Positive
I'll start off by saying it is technically a good movie. The acting is good and the storytelling is good if a bit too quickly paced. It basically starts off at full speed and doesn't slow down. There wasn't really any suspension building in any scene except the bomb test. My biggest complaint is the intense background music that never stopped for more than a minute or two and it gets old pretty quick. In fact I contemplated leaving the theater because the constant dramatic music was driving me nuts. It's incessant and takes away from the film. This movie would have been a lot better if it had 50-75% less unnecessary background music.,Positive
"I won't rate this because I was not able to watch it to the end. I tried twice and managed to watch the first forty minutes. I wanted to like this film, but couldn't make myself watch more. This is when the director gets in his own way by overusing the methods that worked well in his previous films. The sound actually gets in the way of whatever the characters are saying. The CONSTANT sound in the backrgound was like being stuck in a traffic jam with nowhere to go and escape the noise. I either could not hear or was unable to concentrate on the dialog. And because the story constantly switched from now, to the past, then to some near future, then further down the rabbit hole, I seriously couldn't find any other way out but to turn it off. It's a shame, because I like all the actors involved and I'm wishing them best of luck at the Oscars.",Positive
"In the realm of historical dramas, Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a towering achievement, a masterfully crafted cinematic tapestry that weaves together the complexities of science, the weight of human responsibility, and the profound impact of technological advancements on the course of history.At the heart of the film lies Cillian Murphy's captivating portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist tasked with leading the Manhattan Project, a top-secret endeavor to develop the world's first atomic bomb. Murphy delivers a nuanced performance, capturing Oppenheimer's intellectual prowess, unwavering determination, and the moral anguish that comes with wielding such immense power.Nolan's meticulous attention to detail is evident throughout the film, from the meticulously recreated laboratory settings to the visceral depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of an atomic bomb. The film's stark black-and-white cinematography adds to its intensity, heightening the sense of urgency and gravity that permeates every scene.""Oppenheimer"" is not merely a historical biopic; it is a profound exploration of the human condition, delving into the complexities of ambition, guilt, and the consequences of scientific innovation. Nolan deftly balances the historical narrative with introspective moments, allowing the audience to gain insights into Oppenheimer's inner turmoil as he grapples with the implications of his creation.The film's supporting cast is equally impressive, featuring standout performances from Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, and Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, the military leader overseeing the Manhattan Project. Each character is brought to life with depth and nuance, adding layers of complexity to the intricate narrative.""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on audiences. It is a film that demands to be seen, a thought-provoking exploration of science, morality, and the enduring legacy of one man's extraordinary contribution to the world.",Neutral
"Oppenheimer (2023)
Yes, to paraphrase another review, this is essentially just 3 hours of people talking, albeit with a who's who of Hollywood A list actors.The pacing is incredible, and the 3 hour runtime flies by; achieved by making this less of a biopic and more of a political/ courtroom drama.I didn't expect much going in, to be honest, as based on the runtime, I'd expected a slow, plodding affair with excessive backstory. I should've known better.The only complaint I have is there wasn't much emotional weight to this film; but then again, given how much the protagonist tries to distance himself from his emotions, maybe that was the point.9.2/10, A-",Neutral
"This movie is easily one of the best films this century yet despite that it gets called ""boring"" because it doesn't have action sequences in the film. It seems like most people seen this because of the whole barbenheimer trend and not for the story about Robert J Oppenheimer. Calling this the most boring movie ever is crazy. And calling it confusing is understandable but if you paid attention to what they were saying you would understand the timelines. It isn't the atomic bomb movie it's the movie about the physicist Oppenheimer. We need more films like this cause the same mcu bs is making everybody think mid movies are cinema nah this is cinema sorry not sorry.",Positive
"Good, but not really focused on the 'science' aspect of the bomb. Basically a biopic epic about Robert J. Oppenheimer and The Manhattan Project. First off, from a technical standpoint, this movie is basically perfect. The acting is outstanding - and I think Cillian Murphy's performance here has cemented him as one of my favorite actors. The pacing is easy to follow, despite being told in non-linear fashion (it is confusing for about 15 minutes, but you get the hang of what's happening after a while). The stakes, the cinematography, the special effects - all outstanding. The music wasn't especially memorable, but nor was it distracting. My biggest qualm with the movie is this: the central conflict that threads throughout the narrative revolves around politics (whether Oppenheimer is a communist, and/or loves his country) rather than about the actual effort of creating the bomb, which takes second stage. I don't care about politics. It's boring. It brings this move down from a 10 to an 8. That's it. Otherwise, stellar.",Positive
"To everybody saying it's too boring, it's too long and there's too much talking, this movie is based off a biography of Oppenheimer's life during the Manhattan Project, the Trinity Test, and everything that ensured after. This wasn't a movie about the bomb but what it represents. Just like the splitting of the atom starting a chain reaction that detonates, the birth of the atom bomb started a chain reaction of destruction and fear that is still felt to this day. The movie does an amazing job at getting the viewer to feel the emotions that Oppenheimer felt after seeing the aftermath of his creation. Devastation. The way they used imagery and camera work to accurately depict his fragile mental psyche following the bombs dropped in Japan to the blatant collusion of the U. S. Government against him and trying to discredit and blacklist him as a traitor after he spoke against the bomb. Christopher Nolan has solidified himself as a generational talent in directing, storytelling and imagery with this polarizing and operatic film.",Positive
"For those of you expecting massive explosions and thundering sounds of the bombs dropped on the two cities will be sorely disappointed. Overall a great movie spending great amount of time and detail exploring the psyche behind the creator of the Atomic bomb. Science nerds will catch on to same major name drops besides Einstein and be responsible to explain to the normies what ""Nuclear Fission"" means.Cillian Murphy's acting was beyond par and there is no doubt if anyone else could have replaced him on the role. The movie explores the politics in the background of the world war - both government and professional.My honest feedback for those about to watch would be to not buy into the hype of watching it in IMAX for the ""Perfect experience"" because this movie can be watched on a standard screen just as well. In fact I would say even better because a lot of the dialogue gets lost between the bass coming from the IMAX speakers.",Positive
"Man I can't describe how I feel , I feel amazed, I feel sad , I feel emotional. I really wish to watch that movie again if could, like who wouldn't like that peace of masterpiece, Christopher Nolan never let you down when he directs a movie.that Man will be the best director to ever come in history. I can't believe what he did honestly. The film is perfect in many ways
The music in the background, the graphics, the acting prefromance from the actors , the filming. I'll be so sad if they didn't at least win 4 Oscars awards I'll be so f#ckin mad , at last I really do recommend to watch the film at least 2 times and yeah that's all.",Positive
"This thing has been talked about for what feels like the entire last year and it was simply... okay. The acting was good and the visuals are striking at time but the plot itself was kinda boring. They spent a bunch of time litigating his security clearance and like... honestly who cares ?? Lol. I was expecting more emphasis on the bomb itself. And sure the first two hours goes into that but the last hour dragsssss. I was expecting more dissection of the psyche of the people were affected by the bombs going off. You really only see it from one point of view - Oppenheimer's. And like okay we get it, he had major regrets about being involved. But who cares? I would've loved to see more from the victims point of view or the towns and cities affected. It was only okay and honestly expected more from a brilliant film maker like Nolan. Honestly I'm sure my opinion on the film is highly affected by the CRAZY STUPID HYPE surrounding this film. Mind you, when films have a lot of hype, I tend to temper my expectations. And I did with this one too, but even still it didn't live up to what I was expecting.If you're wondering if you should see this in theaters, I say no. You'll get just as much of the experience by watching it at home. Especially since the movie is soooo dialogue heavy and the bomb scene is really short. Also, since this is a review with spoilers, it doesn't even show the actual bomb!!!! So stupid. Just the testing leading up to the bomb. I was here expecting some cataclysmic explosion and watching these towns get destroyed (in hindsight I know it's barbaric and I am not a sadist in the slightest, I don't even like true crime shows to the level most people do lol). But I just expected... more.",Positive
"An interesting man to create a movie about and Cillian Murphy did great job portraying him, but obviously the main appeal of the story is how he created the atomic bomb. Did they show what went into that project? Sure, but it wasn't the main focus. The majority of the movie was much more about Oppenheimer's personal life, including his political views and relationship issues. I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself. If it was half as long and was more about the bomb, I would have rated it much higher.",Positive
"I don't know what to say about this film, but it was amazing!!! I had several emotions going on in me watching this. One moment I was shocked, other moment excited, the other angry, and some moment sad and disappointed. I can't really talk about how incredibly wonderful it was. The saddest part about the movie, was that you knew you're literally watching the reality in a movie:(
basically, it's about Robert Oppenheimer who invented the atomic bomb and made it with the help of other scientists.NOTE: it's better to learn a little about history of world was II before starting to watch this. I decided to do that because in that case it was easier to imagine how was the situation back then.",Positive
"This movie was, in short, a masterpiece. The dialogue, the perfectly timed shots, it swept me off my feet. Cillian Murphy played his role to perfection, I couldn't have asked for a better performance. If I had one critique, it would be the lengthiness of the film. It was a bit long for me, and while I understand it had to be a longer film for the whole plot to unfold I felt that at the last 30 minutes or so I unfortunately got a bit exhausted at the prospect of the film continuing much longer. Though, that said, I very rarely write reviews of anything, but I felt this particular movie was more than deserving of my attention and time.",Neutral
"... and it's not like I didn't know how it ended.This was a great accomplishment by Nolan, a tremendous visual spectacle that was also very dialogue intensive. That would lead to my only criticism, which was that the IMAX cameras, which lack soundproofing but of which Nolan is quite the fan, cause the dialogue to be obscured. I had to start over about ten minutes in and turn on the subtitles on the blu ray. I don't know what I would have done if I had tried to watch it in a theater, but I digress.Cillian Murphy does an outstanding job as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. I watched a ""making of"" documentary that came with the film, and Murphy said that the vast majority of the footage of Oppenheimer that exists consists of Oppenheimer giving lectures or speeches rather than just casually talking, so that it made it hard to get a feel for the man. He uses that in his performance as you see the portrait of someone who feels and thinks deeply but keeps his cards close to his vest in most cases. He really is an enigma.The film does go back and forth in time like so many Nolan films, but I did not find it confusing like I have found to be the case in some of his other works. Maybe that is because I already knew quite a bit about Oppenheimer's life, so I'd have to say YMMV.I'd say that the real tragedy of Oppenheimer's life was becoming somewhat of a political figure while not really having political instincts himself. Because in politics, they need you until they don't, and Oppenheimer wasn't really needed after he delivered the bomb, and so he was buffeted about by the changing times and one of the most paranoid episodes in American history, the age of HUAC and the red scares of the 1950s.I'd highly recommend this film as one of Christopher Nolan's best works. There are so many fine supporting performances including Matt Damon as the gruff Major (and later General) Leslie Groves and Robert Downey Jr. As the paranoid Lewis Strauss. The film may be three hours long but the time just flew by.",Positive
"It was perfect. Perfect. Everything, to the last minute detail. Nolan was not kidding when he said that the movie was going to be bomb (literally).The screenplay and the cast selection, the writing, the delivery, the shooting. No words. I believe that there isn't any other movie that can compete with the craze and the movie itself. The only downside is that you can loose track of the movie if you don't stay focused.Seeing Robert Downey JR after endgame was really a sight for sore eyes, and the chemistry between all of the characters was something unreal!Summing it up, this is definitely a must watch along with Barbie (Oppenheimer better).",Neutral
"History is hardly ever as straightforward and simple as we something believe it to be. The same goes for people like J. Robert Oppenheimer. In learning about World War II and the development of the atomic bomb, the thing I remembered the most was that he was a brilliant man who was suspected of being a communist, thereby tarnishing his legacy. That however seems to be somewhat of the straightforward simple history we tend to like.Yet if this movie is as accurate as is claimed, a theorist (not just a theoretical physicist) might have an intellectual interest in leftist (specifically communist) ideas while, simultaneously, never fully committing. This was a theme touched on throughout the movie in which Oppenheimer was, in several instances, content to stick with theory.When the Trinity test then took place and he saw what came from theory being put into practice, I do believe that fundamentally changed him. Wrestling with the unleashing of such power and knowing he led the scientists responsible for it, should really change anyone with a conscience.What this picture does really well is show Oppenheimer neither as a saint who might have saved millions of lives at the cost of hundreds of thousands, nor as a sinner caught up in communism as might have been the case during the era of Joseph McCarthy and the Cold War. Rather, he was a man as brilliant as he was defiant, ordered as he was rogue, disciplines as he was cavalier. I believe Nolan, as the primary screenwriter and obviously director, respects us as the audience enough to leave it up to us to draw our own conclusions.",Neutral
"Oppenheimer is a breathtaking masterpiece that earns a resounding 10 out of 10! This cinematic gem, directed by the genius Christopher Nolan, transports audiences to the fascinating world of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. From start to finish, the film captivates with its compelling storytelling and remarkable performances.Cillian Murphy delivers a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer, flawlessly capturing the complex emotions and moral dilemmas faced by the brilliant physicist during WWII. The supporting cast, including Marion Cotillard and Tom Hardy, adds depth and charisma to the narrative, leaving viewers in awe of their talent.Nolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. His signature mind-bending narrative style keeps us engrossed, blending historical accuracy with a touch of speculative fiction. The visuals are stunning, making the era come alive with meticulous attention to detail.Hans Zimmer's riveting score heightens every scene, intensifying the drama and suspense. The use of practical effects and seamless CGI elevates the film, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats during the heart-pounding action sequences.What sets Oppenheimer apart is its philosophical exploration of the consequences of scientific progress and the moral implications of creating the atomic bomb. The film strikes a perfect balance between historical accuracy and artistic interpretation, prompting thought and reflection long after leaving the theater.Oppenheimer is a monumental cinematic achievement that deserves every accolade it receives. This gripping portrayal of one of history's most influential figures will undoubtedly go down as one of Nolan's finest works. If you seek an enthralling, thought-provoking, and visually stunning experience, this film is an absolute must-see!",Neutral
"Long story short, this could've been a way lot better if it was shorter, less complicated and with a bit less of new character introduction.I had no problem with the timeline changing but throughout the movie I thought that I am missing something, Nolan kept introducing new characters and subjects as if we are already familiar with the story, which we aren't, he should really stop making his movies more complicated, great movies can be simpler too.We should've seen the bomb explode more dramatically (he should've used CGI), seriously, I was not satisfied with the explosion, too mild for an atomic bomb, the audience deserved better.It was 3 hours long and yet I felt tired of the pacing, seemed too fast and jumpy, not enough for the audience to fully understand.The acting was amazing which is not a surprise given that the cast are all superstars, so I won't give credit for that.Overall the movie was ok, but highly overrated and not worth the hype obviously.",Positive
"This is by far the best movie ever from it happy moments and to it's sad,it constantly grips your attention and beautiful visuals with what I consider the best ending in movie history it really shows off how powerful and these characters are and the thing is these characters aren't fake we're real people and it has the best soundtrack ever constantly amazing never disappoints now the ending might leave some people unsatisfied. This is where all the spoilers are. With an ending, showing the catastrophic effects of a nuclear bomb, and what I could do to people what up Oppenheimer was thinking is impressive it's ending really makes you think what he good person or a bad person that's all.",Positive
I'm a huge Nolan fan and went into the cinema expecting yet another 9/10 experience. I was disappointed.In my opinion the form doesn't fit the story. It's too infomation-dense to be a movie. It should've been a 5-episode mini series like Chernobyl or a semi-documentury feature on Discovery Channel. I found myself overwhelmed by all the dialogue and the constant switching between time lines.I also thought it was too pretentious. Almost every scene feels like a build up towards something important. The music is constantly rushing you like you have to prepare for something to happen. But nothing happens. Even the moment where the bomb is tested for the first time is an anti-climax.The acting is supercious and there are no oscar worthy performances. Cillian Murphy doesn't have the skills to portray a vast array of emotions. He only has two or three expressions.I give it a 7 for the production quality and the effort that has been put into it. But a 7 is too high for the experience I had.Don't go to the cinema. Wait for it to come out on a streaming service so you can pause to catch a breath and watch it like a mini-series. The form the story was supposed to have.,Negative
"I know my opinion may not be liked by Nolan fans, but I feel this movie was made unnecessarily complicated not because it helps the viewer or make it more entertaining but I feel just to portray a level of pseudo intelligence.Most of the time is spent trying to figure out which time period we are in with the multiple flash backs and flash forwards and even in the main two time periods also things are not kept chronological.In addition you need to either have a background of all the characters involved or then spend a lot of focus trying to remember which name belongs to which character as names are thrown left and right.And lastly I found the movie boring which is very rare for me as the subject was very interesting.",Negative
"I wont comment on Nolan this, Nolan that. I would call this movie a masterpiece because of its humanity & complexity.Oppenheimer is shown as complex, flawed, egocentric patriot. For eg, he is attracted to pretty terrible women, which begs questions about himself. He is arrogant, a brilliant scientist, and a great salesman. He is flawed, but patriotic no matter what. That makes for a very interesting character study.There's also a lot to be said about the violence, and the willingness of groups & individuals to commit monstrous acts. I am very interested in the evil within us. American crowds cheering at the death of 100k+ civilians, women going into trance because of a powerful man wielding an unimaginable weapon of death. All righteous people, mind you. The office discussion about which Japanese cities to wipe out, distilled down to a simple list of names, with Kyoto struck off because of its historical value and honeymooning there was sweet. And ofc, the responsibility of arms control.Then there's betrayal, and the system using people as cogs, with the military squeezing the scientists then ignoring them, if not actively shutting them down. And how to live a life of service despite that, testing loyalty, values, amid the power plays of groups or individuals.Anyhow. A great study of the complexity of humanity, social systems, war, right and wrong, and our propensity for evil. Not your casual romcom, but a rewarding watch if your brain is up for it.",Positive
"I am definitely a Christopher Nolan fan and loved it but if you like action this isn't the film for you. This is quite a cerebral film, you need to pay attention to what's being said. There's a lot of talking, a lot of jumping back and forth, you need your brain switched on. It reminds me a lot of JFK actually.Cillian Murphy is simply sensational in this role. Completely believable and there is surely an Oscar heading his way for this. Robert Downey Jr is also very good as is Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Emily Watson.As ever Nolan makes great use of the soundtrack to build that sense of tension and urgency, and silence is also used very effectively.This feels more like a documentary in parts, it's challenging more than entertaining and at 3 hours it's long although I felt the time passed quickly. It's yet another Nolan film which you can't help but admire but I appreciate it's not for everyone.",Positive
"""Now I am becoming death, the destroyer of worlds""The greatest cinematic experience of my entire life, this movie is 3 hours long, but you never get bored, i really think this is Chris Nolan's best work.The Acting was phenomenal, Cillian easily dropped an academy award nomination, RDJ wasn't really my cup of tea, but he was great, Emily Blunt..,wow shocked me, what an acting, he was perfect for Kitty, Matt Damon, perfectly fit for General Groves.Cinematography of this movie is on another level, Hotyte Van Hoytema really did his job, Academy Award nomination for sure.The score is absolutely fabulous, i really dare to say that this score is better that any other Chirstopher Nolan movie score, Ludwig

"Saw Oppenheimer today on an IMAX screen. I'm an emotional wreck but also buzzing with delight! Finally we get an intelligent, mature film for grown-ups, with scientific wonder, espionage intrigue & political drama all In one. Superb ensemble acting & production. Nolan's pinnacle.One reviewer said they found it a bit too conversation heavy, but for me that's no problem. All The President's Men, The Conversation and JFK are all 'talk-heavy' and I loved those too.I appreciate why many folks found Inception, Tenet & Interstellar a bit hard to follow, but I don't think this is as much of a head scratcher. Yes we jump back & forth across a few time periods in Oppenheimer's life, but once we've seen them all (only 4 or 5), it's fine.I sat in the front row of the IMAX cinema so I could feel like I was absorbed into the film. The sound design is bloody amazing and during a few moments it thumped through my body, it felt wonderful! Superb music score by Ludwig Göransson too.If there's any justice in the acting awards season, whenever they start, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr deserve a stack of nominations, two particularly outstanding performances in a film crammed full of impressive acting displays. I was also absolutely delighted to see Tom Conti back on the big screen, this time as Albert Einstein. A superb actor who I've admired for decades. I'd avoid any reviews if you want surprises on which actors turn up, that weren't featured in the trailer. A couple of unexpected cameos were lovely to see!Overall a 10/10 production, bloody loved it, going back for a 2nd viewing on IMAX after my next payday!",Positive
"I can't help but wonder what this movie would've looked like if it had been directed by a different filmmaker, and I believe that it probably would've been better. Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.The length is another issue. There seems to be a trend in Hollywood to tell simple and short stories over an extremely extensive period, and to tell longer and more complicated stories over a short period. This falls into the latter category. Nothing is flushed out. We jump from scene to scene with no context. Other than Oppie every character felt insignificant, including his wife and his adversary, both played by brilliant actors who are shamefully wasted here. This film could've greatly benefited from a longer runtime.It is hard not to compare this with 2014's Imitation Game and 2010's Social Network, which did a lot more character work and did good jobs at portraying emotions.Having said all that I did very much enjoy this film. Certain visual and sound effects were used to perfection, complementing the theme in a truly awesome way. Although being a massive Nolan fan and having read the book (which helps in putting scattered scenes into context) I'm sure this is somewhat biased.If this had been made by another filmmaker I would've given it a 7.Had I not read the book I would've given it a 6.But alas I give it an 8!",Positive
"TL:DR. - Too long, kind of dull. Didn't care for any of the characters.""Oppenheimer,"" Nolan's latest, brings together a monumental cast that delivers notably strong performances, particularly from Murphy and Downey Jr. Ludwig Göransson's score is a haunting backbone to the film's technical prowess. However, the movie's pacing suffers from its nonlinear structure and a convoluted array of characters, often overshadowing its more profound moments. While technically impressive, the film may be too intricate for its own good, struggling to consistently engage its audience throughout its three-hour run. Nolan aficionados might find value, but others may find it wanting.",Positive
"Oppenheimer has always been regarded by History as an interesting figure for the advancement of scientific discovery. While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames. Primary because of the great reforming given by like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey who gives probably the second-best performance in this ensemble cast. With most of his films, the cinematography is done amazingly as well as the visuals that emphasize of fission and chain reactions of the panning landshot the use of and the lack of color, and of course the big payoff of the bomb and the impact of all, and the Explosions Performances that on the big screen can't be compared to watching it at home.",Positive
"I have to admit I'm not the biggest Nolan fan, so my expectations for this movie weren't high. Nevertheless, it was even worse then I expected. By worse, I don't mean unwatchable, but boring and average af. The dialogue is so crushingly pathetic, shallow, even cringe at moments, it feels like AI wrote it. Visually, there's nothing new, you won't be mind-blowed, which is perfectly fine, but that leaves us with.... nothing to write home about. I came to a conclusion that it would perhaps be better if Nolan solely directed his movies and left writing to others, as it really isn't his strength. This is not movie-related but I'll write it anyway because I can: it would be really nice if directors like Nolan who have a huge fan base and are capable of making good and fresh movies (which I think he is, see: Following) would really do that instead of a vanilla movie made to please everyone and therefore offering nothing of substance. There aren't many people with that kind of reach and I assume liberty/funds to do what they want, so I guess my point is that in a perfect world it would be a moral obligation to use that power to move boundaries and broaden our horizons. This is of course not a direct attack on Nolan, maybe the guy really is restricted by the industry and not allowed to do witty and meaningful movies, who knows. I only wish there were more artist showing the middle finger to the Hollywood studios and insisting on doing their thing (David Lynch I love you)",Positive
"Consider yourself warned
Very boring and waaaay too long. I didn't care about any of the characters or the petty hostilities between them.No need for IMAX--or the big screen for that matter--because there were no compelling visuals.Nolan's non-linear storytelling was confusing and unnecessary.Overly dramatic, very loud score during ceaseless committees about security clearance and communism.Didn't really see the point of the out of place nudity or sex scenes.Matt Damon's character was the lone bright spot.I was totally underwhelmed and can't understand the buzz.Surprisingly BORING.",Negative
"Finally, got around to watching Oppenheimer. I was really excited to want to see it but it ended up as major disappointment. This was a really tough one to watch. Maybe some people enjoy this type of story telling. It felt disconnected. When a story constantly jumps to flashbacks, this frequently and at such a rapid pace it really jolts the viewer. Some of the acting was fully OTT by most characters. I get it that they wanted to portray him as a genius but this came off as trying too hard to convince the audience. I couldn't be the only one who needed CC on to understand the dialog. The sound seemed off, with the music blaring if you turned the volume up to hear the dialog. It also reminded me of the 10 ways to spot a bad movie- where characters from non-english speaking countries speak english in fake foreign accents. I wasn't really sure what the movie was getting at, whether it was his life, his career or the whole invention of the atom bomb since it wasn't doing justice to any of them. This just proves that a very popular lineup doesn't always mean a very well made movie. They also twisted Oppenheimer quotes to make them spicy.",Positive
"This intercuts the development of the atomic bomb(which is where the simmering tension arises from, not the Nolan staple of ill intentioned guys with guns. It is absolutely true that this is mostly made up of guys talking without anything dramatic happening at the same time, no heists, interrogations, death-defying behavior, and it is gripping from start to finish), the hearing to determine if Oppenheimer would keep his security clearance(which smoothly enables this to work in any incident that was deemed vital to the story of him), and the hearing to determine if Lewis Strauss joins the government(which does a solid job of contrasting the two men and their values).The three hours really flew by, honestly it felt like it was half the length. It really underlines how Robert felt about the nuke, and how those feelings changed significantly over time. The massive guilt he felt after Hiroshima and Nagasaki seems like the kind of thing that you couldn't possibly properly communicate. This makes it inescapable. Not everyone will respond well to how it renders visual what people are thinking, personally I thought it worked incredibly well. This does require some knowledge of World War 2 and the Red Scare. You don't need to already know how fission and the like work. That is explained well herein.I really appreciate how relevant this is. It is in part exploring escalation in war(today we're seeing it with drones - the line ""the weapons we have, we tend to end up using"" is chilling) and manipulation in politics(a huge problem right now, one of the main reasons that we are struggling to solve potentially world ending problems like climate change, despite how much we can do technologically). Some have taken issue with how it deals with Communism. It doesn't make the Soviet Union seem even remotely appealing, on the contrary, it just acknowledges the appeal of socialism, as well as the intense government pressure against it at the time. I've seen some call the sex scene awkward, when in reality it's meant to be. The reason that it's handled the way that it is is to underline how scrutinized the titular character became, and criticize that.I recommend this to everyone that believes they can handle the subject matter. 10/10.",Neutral
"It's not often I say that. Joker, American History X, and now Oppenheimer are 3 phenomenal movies that I'll never watch again.Why?Oppenheimer was a fantastic portrayal of Robert J. Oppenheimers life pre, during and post Manhattan Project.The atomic bomb scene was an absolute cinematic masterpiece, and one of the best film moments of recent years (or decades)
The movie is an incredibly heavy 3 hour biopic that never slows down. It's a heavy watch, but the payoff is phenomenal.Cillian Murphy puts on his best cinematic performance yet, and Christopher Nolan takes us through his story in an expertly crafted movie.It's as close as I can get to being a perfect movie, but one that I'll likely never revisit.If you haven't seen it, go while it's in Theatres.",Positive
"Murphy is an exceptional actor, in the movie he was amazing and helped the actors with him to do their best, The sound effects of the movie is one of the best of all time especially in I-MAX theater, the bombing scene was masterpiece, and of course we know that bombing scene was masterpiece, but the closure scene! Oppenheimer talking to Einstein about the chain reaction they thought it will happen when bombing the nuclear bomb and cause the burning of atmosphere and all the world with it this of course didn't happen, but Oppenheimer realized that he already started it inventing the nuclear bomb knowing that all countries will race to have as many nuclear bomb and even advanced on as they can, and imagining that someday they will start a nuclear war that will destroy all the world. This is a scene that i think i'll never forget for all my lifetime
Overall the film is perfection, everyone did his job in perfect way, and i think cillian finally can has his Oscar award.",Positive
"This movie went beyond any expectations I had prior to screening. I could not believe how well the movie was made and how it was presented on a Imax format. This movie had a profound impact on my thoughts, emotions, and beliefs. I have not experienced a film like this since 1990s. The entire cast and crew did nothing short of putting their best work with passion into the making of movie. The energy, direction, quality, care to details is displayed well and they don't disappoint. I was consumed by the characters and their story; that I failed to notice the star-studded cast at first. The cinemaphotography is exceptional with beautiful screen shots after another. The music does well to accompanying the story, and it enhances Oppenheimer's world.This is a movie about Oppenheimer, and we get two perspectives to see into this man's life. It is a movie with complex topics, and it is carried with momentum throughout the film. The audience will need to engage with the characters' words, feelings, and thoughts, as the dialogue is the action of this film. This movie is worth the watch. I would recommend it.",Positive
"When you see Oppenheimer, what catches your attention is how a three-hour film full of dialogue is so long and doesn't get boring. The wonderful Murphy plays the role of Oppenheimer, and the good thing about the film is that instead of being about the atomic bomb, it is about Oppenheimer himself.The film is able to portray the pressure and torment of conscience that Oppenheimer suffers after the bombing in Hiroshima and also raises a big question. Whether the things we got after the atomic bomb were worth it or not.I recommend to all cinema friends and fans of Nolan not to miss Nolan's three-hour masterpiece about the most important 4 lines in history.",Positive
"""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves a perfect score of 10 out of 10. The film is a riveting exploration of the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the ""father of the atomic bomb.""The director's meticulous attention to detail, combined with the stellar performances of the cast, immerses the audience in the complex world of nuclear physics and the moral dilemmas faced by those at the forefront of scientific discovery. The film's narrative is both engaging and thought-provoking, prompting viewers to reflect on the implications of scientific progress and the ethical responsibilities that come with it.The cinematography is breathtaking, with each frame carefully composed to enhance the storytelling. The score complements the film perfectly, heightening the emotional impact of key scenes.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a must-watch film that expertly combines historical accuracy with compelling drama. It's a thought-provoking exploration of one of the most significant figures in history, and it's well deserving of a 10 out of 10 rating.",Neutral
"Oppenheimer is a overall mediocre film. It depends too much on sound effects, and loud, sudden flashes as seen in the beginning, the only thing that makes the film engaging to the audience. There is a lot of unnecessary content, and is hard to understand even for Christopher Nolan standards. The fact that there isn't a lot of suspense is understandable as we all know that the Atom bombs would be dropped in the end, so suspense is attempted through chopping up the timeline and scattering it throughout the movie. It would've been better for the film if the bombs were shown dropped in the beginning and have the story told in a reversed manner.",Neutral
"After watching this movie 2 times, once at the cinema and once in blue ray, i can confirm that this, together with interstellar are, in my opinion the two best movies in the whole cinema universe. From the story itself to how Chris decided to tell it, you feel the tension to know more throughout the whole movie, except for the end, where you feel a sense of calmness but also of stress, where you get to ask yourself thousands of questions to which you don't know how to answer. This is not only a movie, but it is an experience that i highly suggest you go watch! Unfortunately, as i live in italy, there aren't some actual 70mm IMAX movie theaters, but, if you can and it they do screen it again in IMAX 70 mm, i'd highly recommend you go watch it!",Positive
"Nolan's movies are about science and explanations and art. This was a bad biographic movie about a controversial person.It bothered me that it tried to control your knowledge of history by not telling you anything about the McCarthy period, the reason why Nazi Germany lost the war and why America choose Japan as a target.Nolan decided to shoot a historical drama without mention any accurate historical evidence. So sad.I liked the acting skills of the whole cast and, of course, the direction.Generally, it was a nice movie, but it tried so hard to convince the audience about things that never even happened in order to prove that the Americans are always right.Nice acting, sound, cast and direction.",Negative
"SO classic, as soon as there's a movie with a somewhat 'deeper' meaning, people would praise it beyond.measure and even talk about oscars...even though there are SO many other movies that are way..WAY better than this one. But i guess it's all about the genre that counts, not the actual movie. If it's a horror or comedy flick, it can't be good right? Well...it's not an entirely 'bad' movie but literally nothing's happening for 3 hrs straight. The whole movie is just one long dialogue...for 3 hrs.There is no action, nothing for 'the eyes'. You could easily just listen to the movie and you wouldn't miss a thing. So, if that's what you're hoping for, skip this one.Everybody is acting very well but let's not beat around the bush...it's hella boring.If this movie is going to win anything, it's just goes to show how damn shallow people are. All that matters is the idea of the subject..not the outcome.",Positive
"After making an action movie where the action was more confusing than anything else, Nolan strikes again, now with too long, too artsy drama film.The good?The actors are all great. They perform perfectly well, as one would expect.The story is worth telling, it's nice someone told it.The bad:
It's 3 hours long. It didn't need to be. At all. It has at least an hour of filler.The explosion is not well done. How the can you make an atomic bomb explosion boring? It's unbelievable.Nolan made artsy stuff with the audio and the video again, playing with unnecessary noises and images and stuff.It's 3 hours long, it didn't need to be
Oppenheimer's wife is a nice character that's a lot more interesting than a few others, and it should have had more screen time.It's 3 hours long.Conclusion:
Good characters, good story, bad direction. Nolan made action boring with Tenet, and now it made boring the creation of the atomic bomb.",Positive
"Easily one of the best films I have ever watched ever. Everything from the story to the acting and the way it was shot was done so so well. The music drove the story onward and it is so well crafted. Yes, it is long but I didn't feel like it dragged at all. Certain moments are slow sure but I was so invested in the movie that it didn't feel like a drag at all. I've seen it 5 times since it came out and every time I'm blown away by it. Truly, Truly and exceptional film and the cast is just incredible. So many notable actors that just knock it out of the park with their roles. Mainly Cillian Murphy. He was absolutely stellar in this movie. He should win Best actor right now, he was that good. Overall, one of the best films I've ever watched maybe even the best. It's that good.",Positive

"Seen it yesterday July 20.Basically, all the praise already given in this space to ""Oppenheimer"" is merited so I am not going to bother everybody with repetitions or with vain atempts to say the same by other words.I will only highlight what in my personal view is the most impressive achievement in technical terms as a whole: terrific sound effects, gorgeous music, great mixing. Ludwig Göransson, whose work until now I was not familiar with, is almost certain to be decorating some shelf at his home with a certain golden statuette by, let's say, next spring, if you catch my drift.A tsunami of award nominations, possibly very close to record breaking numbers is lying in wait for this film.I have seen all Christopher Nolan's movies.This is his best.9.5 out of 10.P. S. The reasons why this masterpiece does not get a perfect 10 are, first, the fact that the dropping of ""Little Boy"" and ""Fat Man"" constituting horrendous crimes against humanity was not conveyed clearly and conclusively enough and, second but equally important, what happened to the populations around Los Alamos in the weeks, months, and years immediately after the ""Trinity"" test? All fine and dandy? Lived happily ever after? Radiation contamination doesn't apply there? I don't think so.",Positive
"Oppenheimer made the bomb, yet failed to puzzle out power. All happened was a must, one way or the other.It is a brilliant tryout of Nolan. A feast of storytelling, directing, and acting. The film was build upon dialogues and events to reveal the complexity of entanglement among science, people, politics, and power. Together, history was made of a must through everyone holding their grounds and taking sides with or without doubts and questions that no one dare to answer. It is a sincere film load with various flavors to chew on.It does take quite bit of history knowing to better enjoy the movie.",Positive
"In a world that's problematic you're perplexing, spending your time with particles, that are complexing, pushing boundaries to their limits, the fission/fusion of new physics, with the clashes, conflicts, contests you elicit. As a consequence you setup two big bangs, when you execute through governmental plans, although this story does not dwell, on the hell that you propel, to the people who are wiped out in Japan. In the end we're left to ponder motivations, of those who seek to play, with torments and damnations, of those who hide inside the shadows, pulling strings in Emperor's clothes, as they plot to raze the cornerstone foundations.",Neutral
"""Oppenheimer"" or ""How the Father of the Atomic Bomb learned to start worrying and Hate the Bomb""In this story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer it's not just about his role in the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, but also the machiavellian manoeuvres going on to discredit him in the United States.The downfall of Oppenheimer is the main thrust of this story arc, long after he helped his government build the A Bombs that landed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing thousands of innocent civilians to end World War 2 even though Adolph Hitler was already dead and the Germans had surrendered.""Oppenheimer"" is the most promising and prominent Oscar bait so far of 2023 for Best Picture, Screenplay, Sound Engineering, Actor, Supporting Actor etc.If this doesn't sweep the floor then I don't know what will.Cillian Murphy is outstanding, Robert Downey Jr. Unrecognisable at first and gives a very different performance.It's almost like he's channeling F. Murray Abraham (""Amadeus"") and ""My Left Foot"" star Daniel Day Lewis.In fact, the way this film plays out reminded me of the genius of ""Amadeus"".This is one of the most impressive uses of an all-star cast I've ever seen.More often than not the higher the star count the lesser the movie, but director Christopher Nolan (""Dark Knight"") manages to herd his cattle even better than Alfred Hitchcock.I'm talking about Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Gary Oldman, Emily Blunt, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek & Aussie Jason Clarke to name a few.These actors transformed themselves for their roles superbly.The only actor noticeably absent from this ensemble was Michael Caine who's been in many Nolan movies.Somehow no CGI was harmed in the making of this movie...none at all, despite the awesome Visual SFX.It's not the first time Murphy & Nolan have worked, it's their sixth collaboration, but it is Cillians first time as the lead in one of Christopher's movies as the American theoretical physicist and Project Director of The Manhattan Project to create the first nuclear weapons of mass destruction.Plus I tips me hat to composer Ludwig Gorannson for his score, which takes this movie to another level.Special shout out also to cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema who worked with Nolan on ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk"" and ""Tenet"".""Oppenheimer"" is based on the biographical book ""American Prometheus"" and when Nolan saw the cover art on the book he could only see Murphy in this titular role.Warning: Nudity & Sex scenes (in a movie about scientist nerds...I know right!)
After sitting through 3 intense hours of what could have been dry fodder in the hands of lesser people (it's very wordy dialogue centric so please pay attention) I can understand why ""Oppenheimer"" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year.I saw this in The Lounge/Gold Class so I can't begin to imagine how mind blowing ""Oppenheimer"" will look and sound in its intended IMAX format and for the first time ever Kodak invented Black and White IMAX film just for this movie.This is possibly the best, most important movie ever given the rumblings of war mongering in the world today.As J. Robert Oppenheimer states in this movie, ""I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know the Nazis can't.""
This could possibly be Director Christopher Nolans Magnum Opus!",Positive
"Maybe i was expecting too much but the movie did not fullfill my expectations. Unfortunately the storyline was too long. At the beginning all the scenes were too short for me and i found it difficult to follow what was going on. The scenes were like a movie teaser.(difficult for audience) the ending part-trial and the hearing part- was too long again. Very boring actually. I can only remember someone being interrogated and answering.. also, i found it really interesting that usa made from this kind of man(oppie) a so called ""hero"" and ""victim"" and made a whole movie about him. I would really like to know if the thoughts inside his head were like we saw in the movie or not. Maybe he was proud, maybe he regretted it.",Negative
"Cillian Murphy's greatest performance yet and another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Oscars worthy.Highly recommend although i recommend you give it your full attention when watching otherwise you might miss key elements. But if you've seen Nolan's other films, then you are familiar with his way of portraying timelines.The casting in this was perfect and everyone delivered above and beyond.Also, the way Nolan illustrated Oppenheimer's feelings and emotions was so clever and powerful.The 3 hours flew by. I was entertained and kept engaged throughout the entire film.A terrifying and important event in history beautifully visualized in this film.",Positive
"Christopher Nolan movies have always been fairly demanding of the viewer, but I think Oppenheimer finally takes it a step too far. The acting is superb and the subject interesting, but the pacing of the movie demands that the viewer is either 100 years old and has a clear recollection of the time, or has been researching the topic for the past several years in order to fully understand what is happening. The movie feels like a 3 hour long trailer, a speeding train that never slows down to allow the audience to catch their breath. There was a lot of great dialogue delivered by fantastic actors, but it is so mired in jump cuts and overly loud continuous music that it feels like a massive missed opportunity. The best way I can describe it is someone trying to perform a poetry reading in the middle of a techno concert. The movie certainly peaked my interest in Oppenheimer, and I will probably research this time in history more, but I am glad the movie is over.",Positive
"I was a huge fan of Christopher Nolan for years, but went off him following Tenet - a film that seemed like Nolan on autopilot and exposed his worst flaws. So, despite the massive critical acclaim surrounding this film, I feel my expectations were actually quite low.Yet, somehow, I was still disappointed.Nolan is a great director, but he works better when somebody else is taking the lead creatively. The script is a mess and often avoids following the most basic principles of writing, leaving nothing in their place.You might think, based on the trailer, that the film is focused on Oppenheimer developing the first atom bomb. And I wish it was. That's actually the middle third or so of them film. It's the best section of the film, but there are so many people thrown at the screen in such a short space of time that none of them are developed or especially (outside of a decent line here and there) memorable.Outside of that, we follow Oppenheimer on a breakneck tour of well-known scientists, most of whom serve no purpose. Take his meeting with Schrodinger. It's basically the two of them saying 'hi' to each other and then we never see him again.The bulk of the film (about two thirds) is devoted to people sitting around talking about Oppenheimer. It can be summed up as: 'He's brilliant, but can he be trusted?' repeated for almost two hours. Robert Downey Jr is in these sequences (he has nothing to do with the middle part of the film) and I'm not knocking his acting, but for a character with so much screen time he was exceedingly uninteresting. Oppenheimer made fun of him and now he doesn't like Oppenheimer, and that's his entire motivation for being the film's antagonist.Focusing more on the atom bomb project and taking time on the other scientists would have made for a much stronger and interesting film. Oh, except then the film couldn't be cut into a random order, which is apparently clever.I've seen so much praise for Nolan's work here, but I felt like even he felt the film was lacking. For around the first half of the film, there are random shots of explosions and stars with loud noises, as though he realised people might get bored. And, as is well known by now, Nolan mistakenly thinks that too loud = intense and that intense = good. There's no purpose for them, and I guess they stopped at a certain point because Nolan figured anybody who was still watching would be staying until the end.Cillian Murphy gives a fantastic performance, but once again I felt it was let down by the writing. I never felt enveloped in the story or especially cared for his troubles.A big problem this film had to overcome is we know that Oppenheimer was successful. If Nolan had got me really involved, I still would've been enthralled, but I never felt that interested.It's got an amazing cast who incredible performances and it looks amazing, but it was boring, and that's the worst thing a film can be.",Positive
"This was one of my most anticipated films of the last few years and unbelievably it did not disappoint in any way.After the lacklustre, confusing and very hollow experience of TENET, I thought Nolan had lost his way a bit. I assumed that, despite knowing that Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers to have ever lived, I was very wary of Oppenheimer and thought it would not be as good as I hoped it to be.How wrong I was. Oppenheimer is a masterpiece, Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus. It is an astounding work of complexity, uniqueness and originality the likes of which I have never seen before. Nolan has outdone himself - it feels like every piece of work Nolan has done in the past has been leading to this film. The non-linear narrative, the visual/special effects, the character building, the story structure, all of it comes together seamlessly to create a truly awe inspiring experience.Cillian Murphy gives the best performance of his career and one of the finest of the last few years. Every time he is on screen he is captivating, alluring and haunting. The film is properly titled - it is not a story about the bomb, it is a story about how it's creation impacted Oppenheimer and Cillian completely embodies the role. His eyes - his eyes and the look on his face allow you to view this man as a tortured soul, a man who knows he did his duty and did it for the right reasons but who ultimately regrets his life due to the legacy he will leave behind.Oppenheimer is outstanding in every regard - amazing music, beautiful cinematography, gorgeous visuals, a brilliant cast, a sharp and smart script. Oppenheimer is definitely, so far in my opinion, the best film of 2023.",Positive
"From the top tier cast to the cinematography this movie is a masterpiece. The source of historical events of Los Alamos, project Manhattan is recreated in fantastic detail. What I like the most is the fact it's no CGI. Absolute Boss production here with the IMAX camera x special effects. You don't wanna miss out on that movie. Color range with black & white expresses the objective perception and colorful the subjective perspective from Oppenheimer. I'm convinced that I probably missed even more hidden details.Cilian Murphy deserve this spot where he is right now. He's one of the best actors in the world. His best work ever. I can't single out every other actors work here the list wouldn't stop.The score of the movie was produced by Ludwig Göransson. He did an amazing job as usual in his previous work.There come scenes when you spot an actor you were not aware of being here and that's so awesome the way this movie mastered the difficulty of not wasting an actors skill set.Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors of all time. His way of making movies is unique.",Positive
"Greetings from Lithuania.If one thing i could be grateful to ""Oppenheimer"" (2023) is that it reminded me of ""Amadeus"" (1984). The rivalry between Salieri & Mozart, or to be more precise, Salieri's hate towards Mozart and the fact that he wasn't the genius motivated his revenge and hate, and that is presisely what happens in ""Oppenheimer"" - and i will leave it at that.On the other hand, Christopher Nolans new magnum opus ""Oppenheimer"" was master class movie on its own. While the story itself is a true one, unfortunately it did not captured my attention very much because I'm living on the other part of the world and some events that happens in third act of the film didn't really left me interested in them. What did kept me involved was brilliant filmmaking by Mr. Nolan. ""Oppenheimer"" is a real cinema for movie lovers - not especially a Friday night movie theater crowd - this was not a crowd-pleaser by any means. With cast as amazing as in here, i was been glued to me screen because of amazing performers, amazing directing, music, sound effects and cinematography. Script was great and more unique then i could imagine. And i have no doubts that Robert Downey Jr. Will get his Oscar nomination for this film - he stole every scene he was in - this is his take on Salieri.And Cillian Murphy was as good as he ever was.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" felt like a unique movie theater experience, because i will probably never going to see film like this on a big screen soon again. Its ""artsy"", not a mainstream Friday night film and because of that it will leave many scratching their heads. But for those willing to take a chance, this is a biopic like no other.",Positive
"I really enjoyed this! The entire move I felt threatened by what was to come and then felt horrible after. Similar to a 3 act play, and the pacing felt good which I appreciated since the movie lasted for 3 hours.The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the color scheme at times. Sometimes the aesthetic felt like it distracted from or impeded the content-like I wondered how this would work on a home TV / computer / phone / etc.I also questioned if the nudity was completely necessary in the the scenes that had it. Some of them I felt were really important, others I talked with friends about because it didn't seem to add anything to the story.",Positive
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer left me feeling mentally drained-but not out of boredom. The sheer volume of information packed into the first 2.5-hour runtime made it challenging to stay fully alert and engaged throughout. However, by the final act, the film gave a satisfying sense that every shot and character played an essential role in its complex structure, a hallmark of Nolan's filmmaking.The film features numerous shots of characters' faces, which contributed to a feeling that I was mostly just seeing faces and eyes for much of the runtime. While these shots were well-executed, I wouldn't say they elevated my overall enjoyment.From a narrative perspective, Nolan doesn't provide enough room for reflection or understanding the deeper tensions between characters. The emotional relationships are underdeveloped, and this is a recurring weakness I find in many of his films. Nolan favors intricate, non-linear storytelling, which is creative and genius but often comes at the expense of emotional resonance and clear storytelling. He succeeds in conveying his messages, but it's frequently at the cost of the drama and depth that could have made the story more impactful.I also wouldn't call this Nolan's best work, worthy of an Oscar for Best Picture or Best Director. Yet, the film's technical elements-from cinematography and music to camera composition, movements and the exceptional performances of the cast-are what truly elevate it. These aspects are critical to its success, as the movie itself wouldn't stand out as much without them.",Positive
"This movie missed the opportunity to create something great. I don't understand that in a 3-hours long movie, there wasn't space left for the content of the 2 real war bombs that killed innocent people in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. 200000+Showing the evil grin on the devil's face would have been a message for audiences all over the world that would have an impact for the rest of their life. But what is the message instead: Oppenheimer wasn't responsible for that decision - he just built the bomb and afterwards he had regrets. That is what will be left in people's memories. The plot of that 3-hour movie is a lot about Admiral Lewis Strauss and the relationship between him and Oppenheimer. An ego war.Another missed chance: The visuals of the nuclear explosion were without CGI. But think about it: filming a fire explosion in order to make it look like a nuclear explosion, is a bad idea. There is no better reason for CGI than avoiding a real atomic bomb. Why filming a fire explosion? I don't understand it.Positive: the actors did a great job. But it is NOT Nolan's best movie, or even THE best movie as some people predicted.That has been pure hype.",Positive
"Some of the things I think are good about this movie:Nolan's approach of CGI minimalism.The awesome acting by its cast members, I especially think Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Jason Clarke as the highlights of the actingFantastic choice of B&W/color scenesHaunting and awesome score by Ludwig GöranssonThe dialogues that represent the politics, dilemmas, dissent, and scientific discussions that go behind the Trinity testBut I can't help but to feel that something feels incomplete/off about the pacing and portrayal in the movie, it feels like some scenes are too lengthy and sort of dominate other aspects of the story that should have gotten more screen time instead. I mean, don't get me wrong, this movie is awesome and it definitely immerses people into Oppenheimer's great and tragic life story and shows how important of a person he was, but it feels like there is an imbalance in the storytelling and how long things are told. It feels like considering the significance of the story of Oppenheimer, there is something that feels imbalanced in the film.",Positive
"To be honest I think it was highly overrated. I had high expectations about this movie reading all the positive reviews. The beginning of the movie was rather slow and way to much dialogue. After they started to preparate the bomb the movie became a bit more decent. The acting was really good nothing bad to say on that part but the movie itself wasn't it for me... Understandable if Murphy gets an Oscar for this movie since I can't think of any others at the moment to get it for a leader role, his acting was high class. Maybe if your an American then you feel a bit more interested to see it from different perspectives but as an European I wasn't really feeling it.",Positive
"First of all, I love Christoper Nolan's work. He's the only director whose films I always see in a cinema. But it's clear that he's is now so powerful that no one has the guts to tell him no. He's almost the Stephen King of film making these days, with the end results too often overly long and meandering. Perhaps my Nolan cinema-first policy will end after Oppenheimer.I remember how the filmmakers in the special features to The Godfather Part II (1974) discussed that it took a long time for them in editing to figure out how often they should switch between the different time periods. Clearly no one bothered to ponder this question in the editing of Oppenheimer. We jump backwards and forwards in time so frequently that no scene has time to breathe. This movie manages the almost impossible. It's simultaneously rushed and plodding.Nolan falls into his regular trap of telling instead of showing.We're told by other characters that Oppenheimer's a genius. The evidence we've been shown to support this claim is him dropping a beaker in class and not much else. Compare this to A Beautiful Mind (2001) where they try to illustrate how the mind of that main character works. In Oppenheimer that's substituted with blurry macro photography.Two hours into the movie we are also told by one character that Oppenheimer is a womanizer. At this point he has been shown to have had two women. Again, show us, don't tell us.Filming the entire movie in IMAX was truly casting pearls before swine. The huge format added nothing (except production costs I imagine). It reminded me of The Hateful Eight (2015). I was so excited that Tarantino was going to shoot a Western on 65mm, a perfect format for glorious vistas. And then they were outside for like the first five minutes of the movie and spent the rest inside a little log cabin. The same holds true for Oppenheimer, which is 95% dialogue scenes in tight quarters making the IMAX format completely and utterly useless.As for the explosion of the bomb, which occurs around the two-hour mark, I have to say that it was quite underwhelming. Mad respect for Nolan's ambition to not use CG, but perhaps sometimes it's justified. The explosion in the opening of Apocalypse Now (1979) and at the end of Blown Away (1994) looked more impressive than the one in Oppenheimer, which is covered mostly in closeups anyway.The supposed reveals in the end about Strauss' being the secret puppet master behind Oppenheimer's faux trial and the contents of the conversation between the latter and Einstein were, in the case of the former telegraphed so far in advance one can only wonder why Nolan treated it as a reveal, and as for the latter the only appropriate response in a shrugging of the shoulders. For anyone with the slightest bit of knowledge of the atomic bomb program, Einstein's views are well known, and we had already seen plenty of examples of Strauss' vanity in the preceding three hours. But no Nolan movie without an attempt at a plot twist, amirite??As for the results of the bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we are shown nothing. Some abstract numbers are discussed, and the only visual reference we get is of Oppenheimer's face watching a newsreel. For anyone interested in an account written only a year after the bombing I would recommend Hiroshima by John Hersey (available for free online in The New Yorker). Or better yet, visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum which is outstanding.Funnily enough, this movie is carefully toeing the line of decades long American propaganda where the bomb is presented as an alternative to invasion, which is claimed to have saved tens of thousands of American lives (by now the figure mentioned if often in the millions). I would urge anyone interested in this to read Hiroshima Nagasaki by Paul Ham which is an extensive study of the development of the nuclear bomb program. The bomb was never an alternative to invasion, it was a complement. And the Japanese leadership didn't even consider the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The reason they surrendered to the Americans was because the Soviet Union opened up a front against Japan which threatened not only their colonies in Manchuria and Korea, but also Hokkaido in Japan proper.",Positive
"Unfortunately, the film is totally overhyped.I fell for it too.In retrospect, I wouldn't watch this movie in theaters again and I won't watch it a second time.Don't get me wrong. The movie is not bad. It's a good movie. But unfortunately, not more.The movie is supposed to be terrifying / horrifying / shocking? So for all people who have not lived behind the moon until today, it was already clear that nuclear weapons are nothing good and that it is with nothing at all to justify that the Americans have already used them 2 times and now play world police ... !I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and have seen films as Prestige, Inception, Interstellar x times and will watch them again and again. These movies made me think after watching them and kept me thinking for a long time afterwards.This film here unfortunately does not occupy me at all, because I have not lived behind the moon until today as I said!----------Subsequent addition: Honestly, I would have rated the film 6 to 6.5 points.But due to the not understandable masses of 10 points ratings, I just had to give a 5.In the same way that the film didn't deserve an 8, 9 or 10, it didn't deserve a 3, 2 or 1. Just to make that clear.",Positive
"An absolutely stunning achievement in cinema. Nolan rarely disappoints and this is one of his finest. Cillian Murphy's performance was nothing short of brilliant, along with the supporting cast. The sheer horror of what they created in that desert and its impact on history is conveyed with tension and measure. This is a three hour film and it feels shorter. There wasn't a moment where I was bored or felt it was dragging on. Nolan is a master or practical effects over CGI and the trinity test scene was executed so well. Along with the Los Alamos victory speech. Stunning. Overall I give this exquisite film 10\10 and highly recommend!!!",Negative
"Oppenheimer is based on a real story but that story is so well produced in the movie that it almost feel like a sci-fi. One characteristic that Nolan movies usually have is that they are high paced and really pulls you right in. His movies are usually very long but they don't feel like they are when they are exciting the entire time, and how he managed to pull it off in a 3 hour long real story is really why this should be considered a masterpiece.I have now watched almost every Nolan movie from Memento to Oppenheimer and I can without doubt say that its one of his best. Of course he's a great SCI-FI director but this is different just like Dunkirk was before and it makes you wonder what genre he'll do next because his storytelling is on another level.A Director is nothing without his crew and I want to point out how well the casting of this movie is. You could argue that he's lucky to have this many great actors working for him but to pick an actor like Robert Downey Jr for this role really shows you how well Nolan and his casting director knows about actors considering that he has mostly played heroes in movies. Cillian Murphy is probably doing one of the greatest acts in movie history and he should win the Oscar no doubt. It wouldn't surprise me if Robert Downey Jr gets one too for best supporting act but his screen time might be just slightly too limited.",Positive
"I worry about the lack of attention span with some of these viewers who rated it so low. No, this is not a Marvel Action flick. This is a quality film. It is art. You are witnessing great acting and great dialogue within a reflection history and its impact on today's time. The same people rating this movie 6 and below probably would give the same rating to movies like The Godfather. It's quite a shame how conditioned younger people have become to not appreciate real cinema that requires you to pay attention...This movie I'm sure will win an Oscar because it is deserving. The one honest critique I have with the movie is that bomb should have been a mix of practical and cgi effects to replicate the power and mass of that explosion. It was too obvious that Nolan used low angles and perspective to make that bomb ""look"" bigger than what it was. Other than that, this was a masterclass in film making and anyone with the intelligence and attention span to appreciate it will.",Positive
"This movie was good. There were some things I liked and didn't like about the movie. The things I did like about the movie were the special effects, the explosions, and the acting was really good. Another thing I liked about the movie was Robert Downey Junior's character because he is a good actor and I like his movies. Another thing I liked about the movie was that I liked how they were creating the atomic bomb.. Some things I did not like about the movie is the science stuff got confusing and you really had to watch and listen. Another thing I did not like about the movie was that it was a long movie. But overall the movie was really good if you like explosions and special effects.",Positive
"The movie delivers more than i even expected.It's Nolan masterpiece.The story telling was so good and dialogue was so full of emotions and informations about this real life god ( Oppenheimer).The cast was so perfect everyone of ghem did their role so good.Cillian Murphy, Emily blunt, Robert Downey Jr & Florence pugh. And and great Rami Malek and many many others were so perfect.The way they act made me fee like the were the real characters they were representing.Music was from another world flowing through the movie perfectly.The filmmaking was impressive and amazing and the pics & the places we discovered in this movie made me fall in love even more.3 hours felt like 3 mins.This is FILMMAKING in it is PEAK.If Christopher Nolan can't get Oscar on this i really don't know if Oscar really matter if Oppenheimer got dismissed from Oscar as the movie deserves many Oscar prizes for sure.I'm happy i got first release in my country in IMAX.10/10 for me.",Positive
"Review originally written on 22nd July 2023.Review:
A question that many of us ask ourselves is ""How will I be remembered when I am gone?"" throughout our history humanity has accomplished so much. From the Wright Brothers successfully completing the first airplane flight in 1903, to Neil Armstrong stepping on the moon in 1969. These accomplishments are destined to remembered and looked back on fondly for the rest of time. But sometimes what is considered to be somebody's biggest achievement can become their biggest regret. This was the case for J. Robert Oppenheimer the American theoretical physicist who the media dubbed ""The father of the atomic bomb"", for his role as director of the Manhattan Project and the creation of the first ever nuclear weapons. Now director Christopher Nolan delivers his newest film, that tells the story of Oppenheimer and the creation of the weapon that would forever change the world, this is Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer.Christopher Nolan has crafted a work of art with this film, a monumental piece of cinema that will go down as a classic in years to come. Despite having a lengthy 180 minute run time, the pacing was perfection, I did not feel it drag or become tedious at all I was fully captivated by the spectacle I was witnessing on screen. The script for the film is immaculate and is arguably Nolan's magnum opus. The dialogue is expertly written. Every conversation between the characters is interesting and actually matters not one moment of the screenplay is wasted, something which many biopics before have failed to accomplish. The non-linear structure of the film, while a bit hard to grasp off in the beginning slowly begins to fall into place as the events in the story progress, the storytelling on display is a masterclass of filmmaking.The cast of this film give perfect performances across the board. Leading actor Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his career, he manages to capture Oppenheimer's guilt, inner turmoil and fear with his facial expressions and eyes alone. You are witnessing a journey of a man proud of his genius mind, only to slowly devolve into a broken disheveled man being mentally tortured by what his own ego has unleashed upon the world. Cillian is simply magnificent and I hope he receives an Oscar nomination next year. Robert Downey Jr. Also puts on a career best and is a sure bet for a best supporting actor nomination. Another Oscar worthy performance in this film is Emily Blunt's she is brilliant.The production value for this film is immense. The fact that this film was made on a $100M budget and looks infinitely better than a lot of films released this year, with higher budgets is proof that more money doesn't mean quality. Nolan's defiance to use limited or lack there off CGI is commendable. He truly is a filmmaker that sets a huge standard for the quality of his filmography, and the use of a real explosion for the trinity test was something to behold on the IMAX screen. Composer Ludwig Göransson returns to compose his second score for Nolan. This score is phenomenal every single piece of music captures the corresponding scene beautifully, and can also be seen as an audio representation of Oppenheimer's inner psyche. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is jaw dropping. The use of black & white to represent scenes not from Oppenheimer's perspective are unique and are a major stand out, and of course the closing minutes are terrifying. That ending sent a chill down my spine and the close up of Cillian's face is haunting it takes a long time to leave your mind.Oppenheimer is a masterpiece of cinema. Nolan is going to have to create something truly special if he ever wants to try an outdo this magnificent piece. By the time the credits role you will be thinking about where humanity Is right now and how all it takes is a few buttons to bring about our destruction.",Positive
"Oppenheimer (2023):I have seen every Christopher Nolan's movie - not in order but they should be seen in order. You can witness his growth as a director and the growing influence of production companies he's working for. His best movie is still Following (1998) which contained really long still shots with absolutely no soundtrack at all. Slowly, he or his bosses fell in love with Hans Zimmer and similar composers over the years - so much that there's never ever a 'quiet' scene in his movies anymore.Talking about the editing techniques, with the help of cuts, he was able to show three different timelines in Following (1998). He went a bit overboard with this style in Memento (2000) and now it's reached the stage that it literally can cause headaches.Oppenheimer (2023) was, sadly, an over-the-top blend of non-stop overly loud soundtrack and hundreds of cuts with a speculative approach towards the character and his emotions. There were so many unnecessary cuts that it felt impossible to care about any character. These ""parallel"" scenes were needed in Memento, Inception or maybe some of his other movies but why would you need to do something like this again in a biopic? Why was there a need of epic soundtrack when two characters were, for example, having a trivial conversation?A few impressive things about the movie included strong acting performances from some really big names (but I couldn't care about any character just because scenes kept cutting for no reason) and an incredibly well crafted nuclear explosion scene with delayed sound effects - this was probably the closest thing to reality.This movie could have been so much better if it weren't for the forced cheap tricks which, I'm beginning to think, he's very afraid to deviate from. No one talks about Following (1998) anymore and he probably understands that. He is stuck in his comfort zone and he won't ever get out of it. I recently found out that he's a fan of Terrence Malick which makes a lot of sense now. However, when Terrence Malick adopts this style, it works. That's the difference.I couldn't like the movie. I tried. I really tried.5.5/10.",Positive
"This is a deeply compelling biopic that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is a masterclass in storytelling, balancing the complexities of Oppenheimer's genius with the moral and ethical dilemmas he faced. The cinematography is stunning, capturing both the grandeur of the scientific achievement and the haunting consequences of its use. Cillian Murphy delivers a nuanced performance, portraying Oppenheimer as both a visionary and a deeply conflicted man. While the film is intense and heavy, it provides a thoughtful exploration of the cost of scientific progress and the burden of its creators.",Neutral
"Having seen every single one of Nolan's films and considering him the G. O. A. T. I've been waiting for this movie for over a year. Sadly, I was left incredibly underwhelmed. It started slow and boring and stayed here pretty much the whole movie. There was nothing compelling that happened at all. I know it's as a biopic, but this is Nolan...and where some criticize Tenet for doing too much, he did far too little here. I did not feel emotionally connected to any of the characters, they did not develop the conflict he was alleged to have felt, it was so difficult to understand the actors at times due to low speaking, poor accents and ridiculously loud bursts of music and sound, and it was about 45-60 minutes too long with dialogue in many places that not progress the storyline in any substantive way nor was it interesting. The only thing that kept me awake as long as I did was that the movie jumps around between around 3-4 different time periods while telling Oppenheimer's story. But you could spend 30 min on Google and get the same information you get from this movie or watch any of then various documentaries out there and get more excitement.Was this a bad movie? No, not in the least. But the hype around this movie centered on 3 things: 1) Nolan, 2) His take on Oppenheimer, and 3) The start studded cast. Only the latter delivered, and having seen the movie I now understand why so many A and well liked B list actors were needed.",Negative
"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/20/2023)",Positive
"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a deep and complex biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist behind the atomic bomb. With a riveting performance from Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, the film explores the moral dilemmas and huge impact of this scientific achievement. Nolan manages to combine dense narrative and historical elements with a distinctive visual style and deep character development. The dramatic musical score and captivating cinematography add to the movie's strengths. ""Oppenheimer"" offers a thought-provoking and highly engaging cinematic experience, making it one of the best biopics in recent years. The 9 rating reflects the exceptional quality of this movie, although some may find its long duration to be a challenge.",Positive
"After successfully leading the billion-dollar Manhattan Project in the race to beat Nazi Germany to the atomic bomb, physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer deals with the ethical implications of the 'genie he let out' while finding himself under investigation as a national security risk. Apparently reasonably accurate (by Hollywood standards anyway), Christopher Nolan's film is a well-executed historical drama highlighted by outstanding cinematography. Cillian Murphy, who can pull off fine hat, is very good (even if he seems to be 'vogueing' occasionally for posters and lobby cards) as he heads up an ensemble cast who are given excellent material with which to work. I'm not a big fan of non-linear storytelling (I find the sudden shifts in perspective breaks up the narrative flow as I struggle to match up the numerous characters with their counterparts in other time-frames) but Nolan is very good at this sort of 'time-space' trick (of which 2017's 'Dunkirk' is an outstanding example). The only scenes I could have dispensed with were when 'Oppy' was being questioned and would briefly manifest his flashback in the present (eg when he recalls having sex with commie Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), suddenly we're treated to them 'in flagrante delicto' in the interrogation room - a silly, gimmicky and unnecessary flourish to an otherwise mature film). A tiny flaw (IMO) in an otherwise outstanding work.",Positive
"The film opens with deafening explosions, powerful fire flames and enchanting images of various stars. The career of J. Robert Oppenheimer, which will ultimately lead to the invention of the atomic bomb, is far from ordinary. As a physics student, 'Oppie' is dreamy and driven, but also mentally unstable and sad. Fortunately, he has his great love, quantum physics, to keep him going. Even if you understand the ins and outs of physics, Oppenheimer manages to keep you interested and to give you an insight into the technology behind the development of the first atomic bomb.Oppenheimer quickly rose above many physicists with his genius brain. What started as a passion for nuclear fusion culminated in a project to be the first to create the atomic bomb. In Los Alamos, the scientist works with a team of his own students from Berkely and a group of European scientists in an isolated environment to make nuclear bombs. Oppenheimer realizes that making a bomb is more than a passion project and that the consequences may not match his political ideas. In an America that fears anyone who disagrees with the country's leaders, he dares to speak out about the way war is being waged. Unfortunately, expressing his doubts and ideas about the use of the atomic bomb has major consequences for his career and subsequent life.Great movie, the only disappointment is the supposed Dutch sentence that Oppie speaks. No one in our Dutch family could understood a single word 😄",Positive
"I'm a Nolan fanboy, but I'll be honest, I was not terribly excited for this film. An extremely long, talky drama about a historical event didn't seem up my alley, but man was I glued to the screen for the entire 3 hour experience. Nolan has mastered the skill of heavy dialogue with quick cuts to keep things moving and engaging. He lets the little moments breathe too, it's not all breakneck speed. This balance makes for a highly enjoyable viewing experience.Murphy is outstanding and may be the favorite for Best Actor as it stands. Speaking of that award, there are Oscar winners littering the screen here all delivering fine performances. The production design is top notch and the Trinity test is one of the coolest things put to film.I know there is a lot of divisiveness about the final third of the film, but I'm shocked by this. I found it to be the real meat of the story. Digging deeper into the implications of the bomb on Oppenheimer's life and the world as a whole is more interesting than just seeing a recreation of what happened. I was utterly captivated for the entirety of the incredible film. Mr. Nolan has done it yet again.",Positive
"I entered the movie theatre expecting a great movie about the nuclear bomb and its impact on Oppenheimer, but no, it was actually about Oppenheimer and his impact on himself and the world around him.The Best biography film I have ever seen, the best Nolan movie and more importantly the best of this year.Every character is well served and all got a great drama, influence, and performances.If Cilian Murphy didn't get his Oscar this year it will be one of the greatest crimes in the history of the academy awards that exceeds the crime of not nominating Jake Gyllinhal for Best Actor on his role in Nightcrawler.RDJ didn't lie when he said that's the best film he has been in and he had his best performance too and my man made Zodiac!I was shocked by Emily blunt as I bever thought she got that performance in her.Florence Pugh's character maybe is not what I expected, she didn't get to show us her incredible performance that we used to see it as her screentime was incredibly short, and her drama isn't served so well yet so influential.I stongly recommend this movie for any film fans, and if you could attend this movie in IMax theaters u will have the best experience ever as the music pumps in your heart.",Positive
"The fastest moving 3 hour movie I've ever seen. It's not action-packed, it is deeply character based and in intellectual and it was the most exciting movie-going experience I've had in a long long time. Cillian Murphy proves that he is a movie star, Emily Blunt is S-tier and Robert Downey Jr is back to let you know that he doesn't just do superhero movies. He's a real actor and he nails every moment. Every A List actor from the last twenty years stops by for a scene or two and frankly they all kill it. This movie feels like an event. Not one false note in any of the acting and three hours goes by in a flash.",Neutral
"This movie has too much going on and not enough at the same time. The focus seems to be communism and a senate confirmation hearing rather than the reasoning and human impact of the bomb. The war is always far off and distant, the impact on Japan only briefly mentioned, and the real person we are to have sympathy on is the title character. Even the building of the bomb lacked the challenge and exploration that it could have. It could have been at least 30 minutes shorter and even shorter focused less on the communism angle. While it hinted at why the bomb may have not needed to be dropped, since the viewer is left with no understanding of the state of the war with Japan it feels like more of an intellectual discussion than an in the moment approach to bringing the world's worst war to a close.",Negative
"I went to see Barbenheimer with high hopes for this because I've been anticipating it since it was announced and this was truly the most excited I'd had been for a film in a while. My best friend had done Barbenheimer a few days before and told me to watch Oppenheimer before Barbie, but I'm starting to deeply regret that decision. Oppenheimer was so incredible that the bar was set tens of thousands of kilometres into the sky, which probably made me enjoy Barbie much less than I would've on it's own. I was still processing this masterpiece even when all the Kens went to all out beach war.There isn't one bad thing I can say about this film. I'm truly stunned at the passion, dedication and effort put into this absolute masterclass in film-making. The film is 3 hours long but none of the scenes are boring, quite the contrary, and it goes by much faster. The camera work and lighting is absolutely phenomenal, which really isn't surprising when Hoyte van Hoytema is your cinematographer. The use of extremely bright lights to mimic the explosion of the bomb, as well as to convey a feeling of anxiety, panic and guilt is incredibly well thought out and used extremely appropriately. The performances are also out of this world : Emily Blunt is extraordinary, Robert Downey Jr. Is amazing, Matt Damon is great, David Krumholtz is so fun to watch, Benny Safdie is dramatic but not to the point of being melodramatic and delivers a great performance, Florence Pugh really delivers as well, and not to mention Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, which is, in my humble opinion, one of the best and most well-casted performances of all time. The writing is phenomenal, the character work is phenomenal, the soundtrack is phenomenal, the cinematography is phenomenal ; what more can I say except that Oppenheimer is truly one of the most breathtaking pieces of media ever made.",Positive
"Acting was great, considering the plot is a boring documentary buried underneath a pretencious confusing cerebral adventure through multiple timelines. This movie was seemingly written by somebody who is old and confused, unable to piece the story together in a coherent way but able to remember it in extreme detail. A collection of trailer-like cuts almost built for a generation of people with a shorter attention span, making me feel like i was being explained the story instead of watching it.I know this opinion will be disagreed with, but I hated this movie and really couldnt wait for it to end. Yes, yes, the actors are great. Downey performed a character that is interesting and devious, the lead, Cillian Murphy, was very good and carried the movie all the way through. Unfortunately he was forced to carry this documentary on his back because of the poor story construction and other charcters getting minimal screen time.Oppenheimer was a physicist, a theory and math based profession that is extremely hard to make appealing to people or to properly explain. Why this was chosen to be a mainstream movie instead of an 80 min documentary produced by netflix is beyond me. So kudos to the effort, it was a solid attempt. However the cerebral almost Kubrick like story exposition was hard to digest when used to tell a more fact based history of a boring man building a bomb.",Positive
"I wonder if all those who are dropping a 9-10 rating after another have all watched the chaos of a movie I did, or they have financial interest on rating the movie positively.Watching a 3-hour long ""trailer"" with unnecessary amount of conversation doesn't do the book (American Promethus) justice. In a typical Nola fashion, especially since the other disastrous Tenet, the pace is unnecessarily hasty for no apparent reason. Music, while being nicely composed, is once again in a Nolan fashion, distracting. Character development is extremely lacking, plot overly complicated for the sake of looking smart. Overdramatizing Oppenheimer's private life and the ridiculous over-focus on the Robert Downey Jr. Was absolutely unnecessary. The best part of the film was obviously Trinity, after that the film went haywire in a chaotic manner, citing the goddamned Communist accusations against Oppenheimer. Yes, we got it. Wish there was as much attention to this than other amazong scientists working on the Manhattan project. I didn't even realize it was Richard Feynman in a scene or two. Barely any talk of the physics, challenges when making the bomb, displaying even remotely the Japan bombings etc.Sorry folks. This is NOT Memento (my fave movie of him), Interstellar, Dunkirk, Inception or the Dark Knight. I feel robbed. Avoid.",Positive
"Was somewhat excited to see Oppenheimer because of Christopher Nolan, although Nolan has had some misses (Dunkirk, Intersteller, the Prestige to name a few) I still usually like his style. There are some big people in this movie so I guess the draw was that this was supposed to be a big movie, however I felt it fell flat and was actually coming across very pretentious and uneventful. The music suggests that this is very intense and suspenseful but was actually quite irritating.The skipping around made it more confusing to watch and it ended my interest to where I just didn't care and was doing a word search game while watching, it's entirely too long and scattered and you really don't care for a anyone, much less Oppenheimer himself, sorry. I guess my expectation of this movie was completely different from what I got. Disappointed, it mostly boring.",Negative
"One of the greatest directors of our generation - Christopher Nolan has produced yet another masterpiece. Recency bias compels me to crown Oppenheimer as the greatest Nolan film ever. Right from the casting, to the costumes, to the set, to the screenplay, to the dialogue writing, to the soundtrack, it is perfection.Cillian Murphy is beyond brilliant as J. Robert Oppenheimer and I don't think anyone else could've portrayed Oppenheimer better. RDJ reigns supreme as Luis Strauss, one of the great supporting acts in movies.Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work, this is where Christopher Nolan comes to life. This is where Cinema comes to life.If possible, witness this once-in-a-generation film in IMAX. This is a beautiful composition of reality, science, and history.Christopher Nolan, on behalf of the entire human race, thank you.",Positive

"This is, by far, the most important film of the 21st century. It should win every category. This film is not about the bomb per say. It is about F. Robert Oppenheimer and his grave sin.*Spoilers ahead, skip to end* -I went into this movie expecting a race towards the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the way it affected the world around us, and the effect it had on Roberts life. What I did not expect was a full deep dive into the life of Oppenheimer and the thrilling ladder half of this film. You can physically feel the emotion that is conveyed in Cillian's Oscar-worthy performance. There was not a scene that I felt deeply connected to the protagonist and his efforts, including his unbearable shame and regret. The supporting cast does an outstanding job as well. Most of the supporting cast are capable of a lead role themselves, let alone absolutely killing their 20 minutes screen time in this 3 hour long spectacle. Allegedly, RDJ believed his role as 'Iron Man' would stunt this performance, as he would behave more like Tony Stark. I did not even recognize him until the 1.5 hour mark when his character became agitated. His performance was immaculate. The ending is not necessarily happy, as it ends with a conversation the audience was aware of but did not ever hear. This spine chilling conversation ended with Oppenheimer staring into a pond with grim, thrilling music with a very slow zoom in on Roberts face. The entire movie is a work of art, and the ending left me uneasy, yet satisfied.*End of spoilers*10/10. Christopher Nolan once again proving he is one of the greatest directors of all time. Best movie I have seen in years.",Positive
"In Nolan's filmography, which very few directors in history can rival, OPPENHEIMER possibly stands out as the best, and certainly most pure form of cinema. Give Cillian Murphy the Oscar NOW.Let me preface this by saying, I don't think this movie is for everyone. It's not your usual Nolan suspense/thriller blockbuster movie, and I feel like a lot of people who gave it negative reviews went into this movie with Interstellar/Inception/The Dark Knight type expectations. This is not a movie about The Atomic Bomb or The Manhattan Project. It's called OPPENHEIMER for a reason. And for others, it just may not be their cup of tea, which is totally fine. Maybe the subject matter isn't that gripping to them, or maybe the big science/political terminologies turned them off.Regardless, I find this movie to be one of the best cinema experiences I have ever had. I myself am not a big student of history, but this movie is crafted in such a brilliant way that it's hard to keep your eyes off the screen. 3 hours flew by so quickly, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The acting by everyone was superb, but special shouts need to be given to Cillian Murphy, who really should win the Best Lead Actor Oscar, and RDJ who most definitely will be nominated for the Best Supporting Actor. Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Matt Damon too were outstanding.Prior to me watching the film, I browsed the reviews and many said that the ""courtroom drama"" that follows the Trinity test is a bit boring, but honest to God I feel like that was the best part of the movie, or atleast as good as what came before. It flows seamlessly, and the tension between the characters is palpable. It tugs at your emotions and really does a fantastic job of putting the audience in the mind and heart of Oppenheimer.Visually, this movie is jaw-dropping, especially coupled with the fact that there are exactly 0 CGI shots. It's a ridiculous feat of filmmaking that only Nolan could do. The build-up to the Trinity test will have your heart in your mouth throughout, and the eventual release is terrifyingly beautiful.However I do have one teeny tiny criticism - towards the middle of the movie I felt like we were jumping from scene to scene way too quick, and at times it was slightly tough to keep track. I know this was purposely done in a bid to ramp up the tension (which it did!), but I felt it could have been paced slightly better.And the ending. OH MY GOD THE ENDING. Towards the end I was so curious as to how this movie ends, and holy balls Nolan really hit the mark - it ties the whole story together poetically. Such a beautiful way to go out.A masterpiece by every definition of the word. Quite possibly Nolan's best work.10/10.",Positive
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.Perfect experience.",Positive
"Oppenheimer is an awe-inspiring masterpiece that captivates from start to finish. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction and Cillian Murphy's stunning portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer bring history to life with an intense and emotionally charged performance. The film's cinematography is breathtaking, seamlessly transporting the audience to the World War II era. The intricate storytelling delves into the complexities of Oppenheimer's life, showcasing his brilliance as a scientist and the moral dilemmas he faced during the creation of the atomic bomb. Thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating, Oppenheimer challenges viewers to reflect on the consequences of scientific discoveries. The supporting cast's performances are outstanding, adding depth and nuance to this profound narrative. In all aspects, Oppenheimer is a triumph that leaves a lasting impact, reminding us of the power of cinema to enlighten and inspire.",Neutral
"This movie is like if Terrence Mallick remade interstellar. It feels like the worse Nolan movie from a major studio. Watching it gave the experience of watching a three hour trailer. The non-linear storyline was interesting, and the movie is beautiful from a technical filmmaking standpoint but the story felt tired. The majority of the acting performances are top notch, with one exception, Emily Blunt, bless her heart is very inconsistent and stands out as the bottom of this illustrious class. By the end of the film I was waiting for the end card and this longing was not helped by the all too common terrible theater educate.",Negative
"A very regular biopic, effective like Nolan's films, with a thunderous soundtrack that sometimes prevents you from hearing the dialogues, a dynamic montage; but that does not serve to tell us the story of this man that already has beeen told us:
we know it by heart. It focuses on the character, the action scenes are conspicuous by the absence of tem; Events like Pearl Harbor are only mentioned, the Hiroshima and Nagashaki bombs are not even displayed in a way that Nolan fans wanted.It is a movie centered on the protagonist. Boring, it becomes dynamic but does not contribute or tell anything new. It lasts twice as long as the documentary from the same year and tells us a quarter of what happened.We hardly see images of how The Trinity bomb is set up, it is not explained to us how they reach the conclusion of nuclear fission, some dreams or imaginations of the protagonist appear about the universe, the stars, the fusion of atoms...It constantly goes from 35 mm to an IMAX that doesn´t benefit anything from its use. It totally lacks action and I can say little more about this, my first horrifying disappointment from Nolan.I think it's his worst movie.Simply tell the audience that has not yet seen it: that if they know about the subject, and know it inside out, they are not going to tell them anything new; conversations are going to be intertwined
between actors, shot against shot, jumps in time, a use of black and white and we don't leave the Manhattan project in New Mexico in three hours. It focuses on a tormented character, Cillyan Murphy:
He plays a very good role, and an almost unrecognizable Robert Downey Jr. Is one of the best things in the film. Everything else, nonsense, IMAX without any sense and a Nolan lacking in ideas who has become obsessed with the protagonist and has based himself on a autobiographical novel that is titled: ""American Prometheus: ""The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer"", the title says it all, everything that exceeds the protagonist neither exists nor is expected in the footage.Horrible, as always overrated.4 stars out of 10.",Positive
"Acting was fabulous. Choice of film stock and the way it was filmed also. But (and this is quite a big but), a lot of the scenes were out of focus. Especially the IMAX 70mm shots. It was so distracting to a point that I went looking for focus points (oh look, the ear is in focus). I know Nolan doesn't 're-shoot' but it felt sloppy work.As a Dutch person, I also feel slightly offended that there wasn't even an attempt at Dutch. I don't know what that was, but it was certainly not Dutch. Those sloppy things annoy me when a film is so raved about.Maybe a bit too much hype around Nolan?Stunning cast and a great performance overall, but it's a long way sitting through (3hr) with a bit of a boringness to it.",Positive
"I love Christopher Nolan, but this was honestly a disappointment. Movie mostly revolved around Oppenheimer being ""trialed"" for his political involvement in communism... Hardly takes you through the scientific development of the atomic bomb and the exciting birth of quantum physics. Just mostly a movie about the politics revolving around the atomic bomb. And even that wasn't well done... The movie hardly portrayed anything about the horrific invention of the atom bomb. Just a few scenes of ""Oppie"" having a panic attack and some scientist mentioning it will kill lots of people. The movie doesn't even show the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the consequences that follow... Just a mention of how many people were killed and that the evil politicians to decide on the attack didn't care about anyone. At the end all the movie was trying to do was make you feel sorry for Oppenheimer... Not something that needed 3 hours of build up with scenes of back and forth Q/A and politics...",Positive
"I recently had the opportunity to watch Oppenheimer's film, and I must say it was a rather challenging experience. The film is filled with numerous scenes that unfold at a high speed, making it difficult to catch every dialogue. This fast-paced approach, unfortunately, hindered my overall enjoyment.While the film has received positive reviews, my personal experience was not as positive as I had anticipated. The rapid pace, combined with the abundance of scenes, made it challenging to fully grasp the subtleties of the storyline and connect with the characters.The film's dialogue, crucial for understanding the narrative, often got lost in the whirlwind of scenes, leaving me longing for more clarity and coherence. Despite the hype surrounding the film, it did not live up to the expectations set by its positive reviews.Additionally, it's worth noting that the film's IMDb ranking may not fully align with my personal viewing experience. While others may appreciate the director's unique style and innovative approach, I found it to be a bit overwhelming.In conclusion, Oppenheimer's film, with its abundance of scenes and high-speed sequences, may not be everyone's cup of tea. The challenge lies in keeping up with the rapid pace without sacrificing the essence of the storyline. Perhaps, for some viewers, a second viewing might provide a deeper understanding.My Rate is 8/10 in IMDB Website but it is not my Real belief
Appreciate your time
Longing for more - Amir.",Positive
"If you have an interest in particle physics and want to see a movie about Robert J Oppenheimer, this is for you. Just know that it's 3 hours long and the best parts don't exactly happen until near the end, so you may fall asleep or get bored not too long in. The casting is perfect. I'm glad they were able to find an actor who looks just like Oppenheimer. The explosion effects were really cool though and its quite amazing they were able to do it without CGI. Honestly, my favorite part of the movie was when Josh Peck pushed the detonation button. Give it a watch if you have time, but I'll say I kinda enjoyed Barbie more.",Positive
"I mean, Nolan had to do something to get many fans back after Tenet, but Oppenheimer is even more complex and LOT more difficult to watch and understand at the same time , than Tenet.But soundtrack (however too noisy it is) is great companion to entire movie but can we all agree that very first frame is absolutely , shockingly good , abstract yet absolutely concrete... phenomenal using of rain drops. For me Nolan needs to ease off little bit and do comfort zone movie , something more ""for normal people"" , and yet you kinda wish his next film will be another complex, hard to swallow and watch masterpiece , like this on.. 8/10 is enough for me bc i am little bit disappointed with focsuing on politics rather than oppnehimer´s inner battle before and after the Trinity / Hirosima / Nagasaki - i expected more depression scenes, more fighting with himself.",Positive
