This movie has tons of characters and names introduced at breakneck pace which makes it somewhat hard to follow. Going into it with an understanding of how the story will unfold made it much easier to understand. This film is honestly a pretty much flawless masterpiece and Nolans most profound and meaningful work to date.The constant intensity throughout is something I've rarely experienced in any films and is done to perfection. Cillian and supporting performances remain incredible. The visuals are impossibly beautiful and I genuinely cannot fathom how he managed to make them without CGI unless he is lying. The non-linear aspect of this film is the best Nolan has ever done it other than maybe Memento. The ending of this film is perfect, and without it I don't think I could score it nearly as high.The experience:Nothing can ever top the experience of seeing this opening day in IMAX with perfect seats, but this came close. This viewing was 70mm (not IMAX) but my first movie viewed on actual film, which was very cool.\",\n          \"Just because this is another Christopher Nolan movie, it doesn't always come out great.Oppenheimer was definitely overhyped. Just because the trailer looked promising, I decided to spend three hours inside the theater only to leave unhappy.The cinematography and acting were definitely on point. However, the soundtrack could get a little overwhelming at times.The flow of the movie was confusing. The political drama and hours of dialogues weren't interesting enough to grasp my attention. Too much information in a split second. We kept moving back and forth from past to present. It progressively became harder to catch up. Nearly fell asleep the second hour.A lot might disagree with me, but the nudity in this movie was so unnecessary. Like, this is a science movie. They even put it up during the scene where Oppenheimer said his iconic line. I swear they could've find another way to direct this scene differently. Not everything should be sexualized. It was a turn off more than anything.I was hoping to see some war-action to close off the boring non-stop dialogues in this movie, but I guess not. Instead, we only got Oppenheimer in a plane and lost in his thoughts with the loud soundtrack playing in the background.Personally, this isn't my type of movie at all. I thought I could like it but I would lie to myself if I said yes. Therefore, it's a three.\",\n          \"I am a Christopher Nolan fan, particularly drawn to his original works. Biography and real-life storytelling also intrigue me, which is why I'm quite familiar with the Oppenheimer story. Based on the trailers, I believed this movie would delve into the science of bomb-making and explore Oppenheimer's emotions. In an interview, Nolan himself stated that the movie revolves around Oppenheimer, with the supporting cast merely there to complement the main character.With this expectation, I was hoping to witness Oppenheimer's inner struggles portrayed in a way that was far more personal. My desire was to experience the movie through Oppenheimer's perspective. Unfortunately, the film took a different approach, focusing more on the outside world's perception of Oppenheimer and the political entanglements, which I found to be the least interesting part of his story. Such aspects would be better suited for an actual documentary where facts and information are sought. In cinema, we crave thrilling experiences.Many have praised the film's non-CGI effects, but personally, I found the actual Trinity bomb explosion effect to be underwhelming. A movie about the atomic bomb should evoke a sense of suspense and offer the most impactful portrayal of its consequences, not just for spectacle but to evoke a deep emotional impact.As a graphic designer and animator familiar with practical effects, I can usually distinguish between CGI and practical effects. However, the close-ups of this non-CGI explosion did not thrill me.After seeing the movie, I couldn't help but wonder why it didn't take a direction more akin to 'The Imitation Game.' I yearned for a focus on the science behind creating the device and the emotional struggles that accompanied it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "The main thing that I have done for this project was to gather, edit, and evaluate user reviews for the film Oppenheimer on IMDB. Every stage presented both opportunities and difficulties.\n",
        "Initially, the reviews were collected by web scraping. BeautifulSoup was utilized to obtain the information from IMDB. Managing problems when some pages did not load properly presented the largest issue in this situation. We needed to ensure that the code could continue without failing even after it skipped unsuccessful pages. The objective was to gather one thousand reviews, which included handling several pages of information.\n",
        "After gathering the data, we concentrated on cleaning it. This required deleting common stopwords that do not add much meaning, changing everything to lowercase, and removing undesired characters like punctuation and numerals. Making sure that no crucial passages were unintentionally left out of the manuscript was one challenge. Additionally, we used lemmatization and stemming to break down words into their most basic forms. Lemmatization served our purposes better because stemming could be overly forceful at times.\n",
        "Next, we used natural language processing (NLP) to analyze text. With SpaCy, we identified the parts of speech (like nouns, verbs, and adjectives) and counted how many of each type appeared in the evaluations. Next, we employed named entity recognition (NER) to find significant entities in the text, such as persons, locations, and dates, and dependency parsing to ascertain how the words in the sentences linked to one another. Comprehending and illustrating these intricate connections among words in lengthy phrases posed a problem.\n",
        "In conclusion, this project provided insights into how structured information may be recovered from unstructured user reviews and helped to appreciate the significance of cleaning text before analysis. Every stage of handling real-world data needed problem-solving.\n",
